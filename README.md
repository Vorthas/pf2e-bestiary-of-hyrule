This repo simply stores a raw text file of the PF2e Scribe markdown needed to generate the Bestiary of Hyrule on https://scribe.pf2.tools/.

Simply copy the contents of the text file into PF2e Scribe to generate the bestiary.  Make sure that in Settings that Force A4 Layout is enabled for best results when producing a PDF.
