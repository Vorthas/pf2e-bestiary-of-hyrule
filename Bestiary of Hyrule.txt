The world of the Legend of Zelda is home to many fascinating and unique creatures, many of which are monsters that stand in the way of heroes.  Using these creatures in a Pathfinder 2e campaign that is not a Legend of Zelda campaign may cause some dissonance, but with some flavor tweaks they could be used in a non-Zelda campaign without issue.  The same is true for using base Pathfinder 2e monsters in a Legend of Zelda campaign.

If a creature in this bestiary appears in multiple games with different traits, then the resulting creature will be an amalgamation of all the official depictions, or multiple variants of the creature will be listed.

### Differently Leveled Creatures
If you want to use a creature found in this bestiary, but of a different level, you can use the **Building Creatures** rules, found starting on page 56 in the *Gamemastery Guide* to adjust the statistics to match the new level.

All creature levels are set by a somewhat arbitrary metric based on approximately when a monster is encountered in a Zelda game, with some exceptions.  However, as the Legend of Zelda series is not an RPG (it's an action-adventure series), there are no official levels attached to monsters that could be used to approximate a proper level scaling.

### Companion to Adventures in Hyrule
This document is designed to be used as a standalone document, but it is also intended to be used as the bestiary to Aoife Ester's [Adventures in Hyrule](http://scribe.pf2.tools/v/wXO8Df9X) homebrew document for Legend of Zelda campaigns.

### Non-Canon Abilities
While most statblocks will try to adhere as much to game canon as possible, due to the nature of a tabletop game versus a video game, some liberty will be taken with statblocks.  New abilities may be added that make sense for a creature based on its physiology or to make it more capable to fight against a party of Heroes rather than a single Hero.

note (
# Key Terms.
You'll see the following key terms and traits throughout this document.
    **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability trait is used to indicate a specific vulnerability of a creature that may be triggered by targeting a specific location on the creature or by using a specific item or weapon.
)

### Vulnerable Spots
Some creatures have a vulnerable spot, such as an eye, that can be targeted for extra effects.  This is to simulate the Legend of Zelda boss weak point system.  Vulnerable spots will have the ***vulnerability*** trait on them.  Typically these will be called out in the statblock and require a -2 circumstance penalty to aim for the weak spot in return for extra damage or bypassing resistances and/or immunities.

A player can use the Recall Knowledge action to try and identify a Vulnerable Spot on a creature that has one. The GM can provide the player with the Vulnerable Spot in lieu of other best known attributes of the creature.

### Alignment Post-Remaster?
Alignment was left in for each creature despite alignment being removed in the Remaster for Pathfinder 2e for legacy reasons.  There are GMs and players who prefer to play with the old alignment system and so alignment on creatures is preserved for people who want to use that system.  If you want to be fully Remaster compatible, simply ignore the alignment trait in all statblocks.

# Ache ((+Ache))

## Ache ((++Ache))
Called "Eyes of Ganon" by townsfolk, Aches can disguise themselves in the villages of Hyrule as ordinary Hylians. Almost anyone you talk to may be an Ache in disguise, and they often reveal themselves and attack when talked to, striking unexpectedly.
right(
# Eyes of Ganon
Aches act as spies and messengers for the dark lord Ganon, often disguising themselves as townsfolk in hopes of luring potential heroes to an unwitting death.

## Acheman ((++Acheman))
Monstrous bats cursed by evil. They are similar to aches, though they do not disguise themselves as Hylians like their counterparts. Instead, they hang from ceilings in deep red, ache-like forms. When their prey draws close, they swoop to the ground and transform into bat-like men that spit volleys of fire. After they spit a few blasts of flame, they return to their ache forms and return to the ceiling.

# Aerocuda ((+Aerocuda))
An airborne creature that can be recognized by its distinctive cries. They have strong, dexterous feet and can often be seen cruising through the sky with animals or other monsters in their clutches. Thankfully, the breed's lightweight, aerodynamic body makes it easy to shoot down.

right(
# Monster Drop Troops
Aerocudas are commonly found holding blins and lizals in their grasps, swooping in and dropping them as a primitive form of drop troopers in war.

# Ampilus ((+Ampilus))
Ampilus are desert-dwelling animals, resembling a cross between a squilla and an ammonite, with an ability to internally generate electrical energy. Their shells are able to disperse weight surprisingly well, allowing them to safely traverse desert sinksand.

right(
# Quicksand Traversal
Ampilus shells have a weight-dispersing property that allows them to remain afloat on top of quicksand.  Shrewd adventurers can make use of this property to traverse areas blocked off by quicksand.

# Armos ((+Armos))

There are many kinds of ancient statues inside the various dungeons of Hyrule.  Some of these statues are capable of coming to life, hopping after the intruder that alerted them.  It is not known who built or animated these statues as there are a multitude of designs, not matching any one civilization.  The tiny Minish, for example, created some armos statues that they can pilot, but not all armos are capable of being piloted in this fashion.

## Armos
An armos appears indistinguishable from a stone statue, and in fact is comprised almost entirely of stone animated by magic. As a nonliving sentry, it remains dormant wherever its master or its creator has placed it. In many cases, an armos will stay on-guard for centuries or longer, remaining as motionless as the stone statue it resembles.

Armos are usually found in ancient temples, standing silently and unmoving, coming to life only when an intruders walks near.

# Aruroda ((+Aruroda))

Large scorpion-like animals, aruroda are commonly found on beaches, in deserts, and inside caves. They prefer to nest under the sand and also use the sand as a way to hide and ambush any potential prey that comes nearby. Aruroda use their powerful venom to incapacitate prey and then drag the helpless creature underneath into the aruroda's nest to be feasted upon. They are capable of igniting their venom and firing small globs of ignited venom from their stinger, sometimes hiding under the sand with just the stinger exposed to stay out of sight while spraying ignited venom at potential threats.

# Flammable Venom 
Aruroda venom is highly prized for its flammable properties, often being used in the creation of alchemist's fire or as a reagent for fire spells.

**Arrow Volley** :aa: The bokoblins draw or reload their shortbows and launch a ranged attack in the form of a volley.  This volley is a 10-foot burst within 60 feet that deals 3d6+3 piercing damage (DC 19 basic Reflex save).  When the bokoblins are reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 5-foot burst.

**Charge!** :aa: **Requirements** the horde has Formed Up; **Effect** The bokoblins lower their spears and charge.  The troop Strides in a straight line until they're adjacent to an enemy then use Lower Spears!, dealing 1d8+11 piercing damage.  Any creature that fails its save is also knocked prone.

# Boe ((+Boe))
Boes are shuffling, hazy balls that often thrive in the darkness, though a white variant exists that thrives in snow and bright lights instead.  Both types are not very threatening when isolated, and can be dispelled easily with a single attack. However, these floating creatures tend to cluster in groups, and in such situations can pose more of a threat to inexperienced adventurers.

An extremely large bullbo and favored mount of King Bulblin.  It has horns that grow from just behind its eyes instead of the standard Bullbo's tusks. Lord Bullbo's horns are not completely white as common bullbo' tusks are. Instead, they are striped red and white and are much larger. Lord Bullbo's roar is also pitched much lower than a normal bullbo's, likely due to its size. Since Lord Bullbo is extremely large, it is also immensely strong and can easily fling smaller creatures out of the way with its horns.

It is rumored that a deku scrub's disposition can change drastically depending on the type of tree they are born from.

## Business Scrub ((++Business Scrub))
Some deku scrubs take up jobs as merchants, wandering the world to peddle their wares.  They are cowardly by nature, preferring to hide in their flowers instead of fight.

## Mad Scrub ((++Mad Scrub))
Much more aggressive than common deku scrubs, mad scrubs attack any creatures that draw near with the intent to kill. After all, a corpse will eventually provide extra nourishment to the deku flower the mad scrub calls home. They distrust any and all who would approach them, save occasionally other deku scrubs. Mad scrubs can be found anywhere where flora is abundant, but are most common in marshes and wetlands.

# Dodongo ((+Dodongo))
Dodongos are dinosaur-like reptiles that can grow to tremendous sizes. Most of them wield fire breath, immense physical strength, and thick armor-like scales. This combined with their feral aggression make them infamous monsters across the entire Light World. They have a notorious weakness to the thunderous detonations produced by bombs, and are almost single-handedly the reason any worthy adventurer keeps at least a few explosives at the ready. 

## Baby Dodongo ((++Baby Dodongo))
The infantile form of dodongos, baby dodongos are prone to exploding when killed. Despite being very young, they still have a nasty bite. They are small, serpentine creatures that slither along the ground, and burrow underneath for protection and ambushing.

A diminutive form of dodongo, kodongos are simple reptilian quadrupeds with a ravenous appetite. They are usually of either a red or green color, and bear some resemblance to unusually small rhinoceroses or triceratops. Kodongos dwell primarily in caves, ruins, and other dark locations, usually in small family-like packs. Kodongos spit blasts of magical flame at virtually anything that moves, with the apparent intent of roasting it alive and eating what remains—even if they aren't hungry. These beasts are believed to have been evolved to be impervious to heat just so their kind doesn't constantly roast and eat each other.

## Young Dodongo ((++Young Dodongo))
A young dodongo is a baby dodongo that has grown but not yet reached reproductive maturity. Although it is the equivalent of a child and hasn't even fully developed mobile limbs, this monster's fangs and fire breath are more than capable of ripping and roasting the most formidable of creatures. Despite being relatively slow and clumsy for its size, this dodongo hunts endlessly to spur its growth into adulthood. Relatively few young dodongos thrive into the next stage of their life cycle, the king dodongo.

## King Dodongo ((++King Dodongo))
A rare baby dodongo is able to live into adolescence to become a young dodongo, and a rare young is able to thrive into full adulthood as a king. Fitting to its name, a king dodongo is usually the apex predator in whatever caverns or ruins it seeks to dominate. Its lair is often filled with younger dodongos who both serve their parent: the king. These younglings are protected by the sheer presence of the king itself, as its roars and utter power are known to clear almost any other creatures that would bring harm its offspring.

left(
# Hail to the King
Other dodongos rarely challenge the authority of the king dodongo, remaining subservient and in the young dodongo stage of their life.  In the rare event that two king dodongos develop in the same brood, the two kings will fight each other for control of the territory to the death or until one leaves to find a different area to raise a brood.

A dodongo-like creature, the dongorongo resembles a large armored lizard with crystals growing out of its back. Like a dodongo, it is vulnerable to explosives going off inside its body. Some speculate that the dongorongo is an evolved form of the dodongo, others say it is a magically enhanced dodongo. Either way, a dongorongo is a force to deal with in their homes deep inside volcanic mountains.

## Aquamentus ((++Aquamentus))
As large green-colored dragons, any aquamentus is a rare but terrifying monster. Warriors can rarely even do it harm unless they strike the creature's singular horn, the source of the dragon's magical prowess. Such a task would be difficult on its own, let alone with the monster blasting out magical flames at any would-be foes.  Despite its prowess, a typical aquamentus is more of a beast than a warlock—it lacks the cunning for well-thought out plans or long-term goals, despite its longevity as a dragon.

# Magical Hoarder
An aquamentus has an inherent, instinctive desire to find and hoard that which is magical. These rare creatures are known to kill adventurers for their magic items, and drag the trinkets away into some secretive lair in cave or ruins.

Flame gleeoks are three-headed, winged gleeoks.  They are massive creatures, towering well above and even dwarfing other large enemies such as molduga.  Flaming horns grow out of the top of their heads, and each head bears a single eyeball.  Each head can shoot fireballs and streams of fire separately, as well as all at once.

From a distance, an eeno appears indistinguishable from a lumpy pile of snow, and is rarely found not among snow or ice. Its body is in fact almost entirely snow. When agitated, an eeno's body forms a face with glowing yellow eyes to see, and large arms—though it lacks legs, and still mostly takes the form of a snow pile. It wildly attacks any foreign creatures that enter its territory, usually with powerfully-hurled packs of snow or ice it has gathered from the surrounding environment. When all else fails, it will either flee into the depths of snow, or resort to crude but powerful punches.

Sometimes referred to as a "sandman," a geldman appears as a massive, powerfully-built humanoid about 10 feet in height. Its body seems to be composed entirely of tightly-packed sand, save for the stark white and pupil-devoid eyes that adorn its angered face. These monsters dwell almost exclusively in areas of loose sand, such as deserts or beaches, where they spend most of their time just under the surface of the sand. When a foreign creature approaches, the geldman manifests its powerful upper body above the sand, and rapidly "wades" through the dunes towards the intruder. For seemingly for no purpose other than pure cruelty and malice, a geldman attacks with powerful punches from fists as hard as stone.

## Heedle ((++Heedle))
A heedle is squat quadruped with a short tail, and glowing pupil-less white eyes that glow from within a solid stone mask that serves as its face. One can grow up to 10 feet in length. Any heedle almost constantly glows with smoldering ember, and its body appears as though it was composed of molten rock. Much like actual rock, it is virtually impenetrable to conventional forms of attack.

Heedles are often found in small groups of two or three, where they ravenously spread heat and flame across everything in their path. A heedle's existence seems only to serve to burn that which can burn, and it is only hostile towards those who would hinder this endless quest to ignite and scorch all that exists.

# Path of Fire
A heedle leaves behind a path of fire where it treads, making it dangerous to wander in the same region as the heedle.

# Gohma ((+Gohma))

## Gohma Larva ((++Gohma Larva))
A gohma larva—or "baby gohma"—is a newborn offspring of an infamous monster called gohma. Like its mother, a larva is an spider-like creature, but only has two to four functional legs. It peers upon the world with a single eye, and generally seeks the violent destruction of anything not of its own kind. The exact dimensions and capabilities of a gohma larva depend slightly on the capabilities of its mother, but it tends to leap towards its victims with its fangs or slamming its whole body. As gohma eggs are produced in groups, larvae learn to function in small groups of their siblings or peers.

## Fire Gohma ((++Fire Gohma))
Nearly a hundred feet long, a fire gohma is nearly the size of a mountain. Its colossal centipede-like body is layered entirely with incredibly thick chitin reminiscent of mammalian bones. The rare cracks in this natural armor reveal an interior body that glows with searing heat. Its large, singular eye is the only portion of its body left entirely unarmored. True to its name, a fire gohma literally lives and swims in subterranean flows of molten rock, and subsists in part on heat. In the rare instances it surfaces, entire towns can be left roasted by its breath, and age-old trees torn in half by its gargantuan pincer-like claws.

# Goron ((+Goron))
A race of rock people inhabiting Hyrule, Termina, and several other countries, typically living in mountain ranges.  Gorons have been called "rock people" since ancient times, when the goddess Hylia ruled and have long held close ties with the Hyrulean royal family.  They have the capability to thrive in any environment, and in times of crisis, have survived by migrating to different climes.  Befitting with that of their habitat, their durable, round bodies greatly resemble that of stones and boulders, and nearly all Gorons have a hide of ridged stones on their backsides. They usually have light brown skin. They have small eyes and noticeable lips, which conceal unaligned, square teeth.

Gorons possess immense strength which many are proud of, and many groups of Gorons like to hold competitions that test each other's physical strength and even rolling ability, including competitions such as sumo wrestling and rolling racing, among others.  While Gorons do have many strengths, they are also not without their weaknesses.  Gorons tend to move slowly, though their ability to roll can make up for this, and one of their apparent weaknesses is deep water as they cannot swim.  However, Gorons can hold their breath for long periods without ever needing to breathe and thus cannot drown.

## Fyrus ((++Fyrus))
A powerful Goron hero and chieftain who became corrupted by the powers of the Fused Shadow, becoming the beast known as Fyrus.  Fyrus is a mighty being of flame, capable of destruction on a large scale.  Fearing the destruction he could cause in this state, the Gorons of Death Mountain locked Fyrus away deep in the mountain where he remained until one could free him from his fate.

# Goron Hero
Fyrus is the result of a powerful Goron hero named Darbus falling to the powers of the Fused Shadow.  Any powerful Goron could become Fyrus, though the Gorons made sure that nobody else could approach the Twili artifact after Darbus was transformed, locking him away deep in the depths of Death Mountain.

# Guardian ((+Guardian))
Ancient machines created by the Sheikah, originally created to aid in the battle against the calamity of Ganon.  However, the power of Ganon's malice was enough to overcome the programming of these machines, subverting many of them to his will.  Now, guardians are aggressors instead of protectors of the people they were built to protect.  Some guardians were spared from the malice, usually the scouts found in various shrines hidden throughout Hyrule.

## Guardian Scout ((++Guardian Scout))

Guardian scouts are smaller variants of guardian stalkers, built for dual purpose of defense and as training tools.  They have been used as opponents in various trials devised by the Sheikah.  In addition to the beam functionality, guardian scouts are designed to handle weaponry as a means of further testing the combat prowess of one undertaking the trials.  It takes some serious skill to go toe-to-toe with one.

Leevers are sand-dwelling sandworm-like creatures known for their burrowing capabilities, found mostly in areas with sand such as deserts and beaches. These cone-shaped creatures burrow out of the ground, or remain at a semi-burrow, upon detecting movement and begin pursuing threats, generally at a fast-moving pace.  They are almost always found in groups, with many of them targeting and honing in on potential prey at once.

# Like Like ((+Like Like))
Resembling giant sponges, like likes can be found in almost any environment, but are most abundant underwater, near coastlines, or in dank caves. They mindlessly devour anything that moves into their huge, tubular mouthes, with the intent of dissolving whatever it might be while it's still alive. The acids in its stomach can break down seemingly any material very rapidly. Even if an adventurer escapes this monster's gut alive and slays the beast, he might lose his shield, his rupees, or even his armor to its digestive acids.

# Rupee Likes

Some like likes have a small tendril with a rupee-shaped protrusion at the end of it.  These forms of like likes, called rupee likes, hide out of sight with only the protrusion visible, waiting for potential prey to grab it.  Only then does the rupee like strike, consuming most of the prey's rupees.

# Lizal ((+Lizal))
Lizal are a broad and varied race of reptilian humanoids, all of whom are notorious for their cruel barbarism and esoteric ways. Although they are practically as intelligent as hylians, they are callously heartless, and come off as alien and uncanny to outsiders. Lizal consider all races other than their own—and occasionally moblins—to be either their natural enemies, or resources to be exploited. 

## Lizalfos ((++Lizalfos))
The standard lizalfos, sometimes called a geru, is seven feet tall with sleek, gecko-like scales and a bizarrely long neck; the glare emanating down upon you from a lizalfos' unfeeling eyes is more than enough to send a shiver down your spine. They are also the most culturally capable and organized, as they have been known to create large fortifications in what domains they call their own.

# Magtail ((+Magtail))
Magtails are arthropods covered in a hard exoskeleton that not even the searing heat of lava can penetrate. Their exoskeleton is hard enough to deflect most attacks, with their eyes are their only weakness. When harmed, magtails curl up into a defensive position, which can be picked up and carried around.

# Larval Fire Gohma?
Magtails seem to bear some resemblence to the gargantuan fire gohma, suggesting that they are the larval stage of that enormous monster, but this is merely speculation by some and not confirmed.  GMs that wish to play into this theory may add the gohma trait to the magtail.

While curled up, the magtail cannot make any Strikes, its eye cannot be targeted, and it can be picked up as if it is an item of Bulk 3.

**Vulnerable Eye** (vulnerability) The magtail's eye is its weak point.  Creatures that identify this weak point may take a -2 circumstance penalty to their attack roll to target the eye.  Damage dealt to the eye bypasses the magtail's physical resistance and the magtail has weakness 5 to piercing and slashing damage that targets the eye.

# Morpha ((+Morpha))

A morpha appears as a small violet or red orb the size of a hylian's head, surrounded with a slimy, crackling, and semitransparent membrane. One is never found out of a body of water. A morpha is not merely aquatic, but is able to magically manipulate the water around it. It does so to swim at incredibly high speeds, and can even form limbs out of water around itself to grab prey much larger than its body.

Encounters with a morpha are quite rare, but more often than not it is the result of water seeming to come alive and reach out of a lake, pond, or coastline to drag an individual to their death. Underwater, a morpha can slowly dissolve and digest virtually any corpse with the acidic membrane that immediately surrounds its body.

# Morpheel ((+Morpheel))
A morpheel is a large, eel-like, aquatic monster corrupted by Twili magic.  It has a slender body that is covered in red and green scales.  Its body is segmented into vertebrae-like sections that are largest near the head and taper towards the tail.  Each of these sections have a set of longer fins that come out of its back and underbelly.  The tail has a large fan-like fin.  Two other similar fins are located on opposite sides of the head.  On its head, a morpheel has a mouth-like opening with twelve sharp, white barbs.  This protects a smaller, sphincter-like mouth that has finer barbs on its surface.  This inner mouth can produce bomb fish.  Morpheel has eight long, iridescent tentacles around its head.  A ring-like light occasionally flows through them, but the tentacles are not electrified.   The morpheel has a single eyeball that is free to move throughout each tentacle.  This eyeball can rest in a socket on the morpheel's back near its head, too.

Once the eye has been identified as a weak spot, a creature may attempt a DC 30 Athletics check to pull the eye out of morpheel's body.  When exposed in this manner, the morpheel's eye has weakness 10 to damage and the morpheel's resistance does not apply to the eye.  The morpheel's eye will bounce back into the morpheel's body at the start of the morpheel's next turn.

# Mothula ((+Mothula))
Mothula are large moth-like creatures that can fly around at high speeds using a jet of flame they produce in their bodies.  Young mothula are called morths, which mothula are capable of laying rapidly to stick to either threats or prey to slow them down, either as a defense mechanism or a way to make potential prey easier to capture.

# Wingless Mothula
Some mothula have their wings already clipped.  These wingless mothula tend to be more aggressive to make up for lack of flight for protection.

**Rocket Charge** :aa:  The mothula Flies twice using its fly Speed. If it ends its movement within melee reach of one creature, it can make a mandibles Strike against that creature, except the damage is 3d8+10 and the attack gains Knockdown.

**Spray Larvae** :aa: The mothula sprays morths out in a 30-foot cone, which attempt to attach to creatures in the area to slow them down.  Creatures in the area must make a DC 24 Reflex save.  The mothula can't use Spray Morth again for 1d4 rounds.  Adjacent allies of a creature with morths attached to them can spend an action to remove the morths from the creature, which ends the slowed condition and penalty to Speed immediately.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

# Octorok ((+Octorok))
Octoroks are highly adaptable omnivorous creatures. As their name implies, octoroks bear similarities to octopi, and famously spit rocks as their primary form of attack. They can be almost any color, but are most often violet, red, or blue. An octorok has between four and eight tentacle-like legs which are surprisingly functional both on land and in water, enabling octoroks to be truly amphibious.

## Big Octo ((++Big Octo))

Rarely, a normal octorok is able to grow to this immense size, and produces a natural snail-like shell it uses as armor. Unlike normal octoroks, a big octo does not often hunt by spitting rocks, but instead uses the sheer size and power of its body to tackle and crush prey. It is known to swallow fish, birds, and even people whole, digesting them while they yet live.

Creatures must succeed on a DC 24 Athletics check or be pulled up to 10 feet towards the big octo (20 feet on a critical failure).  If a creature is within 10 feet of the big octo, the big octo uses Swallow Whole on it.  Unattended objects are automatically pulled.

**Octo Charge** :aa: The big octo Strides twice, then makes a slam Strike.  As long as the big octo moves at least 20 feet, the Strike's damage increases to 3d10+9.  A Medium or smaller creature struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or be automatically shoved back 10 feet and knocked prone by the force of the blow.

# Redead ((+Redead))

## Redead  ((++Redead))
A vaguely humanoid-shaped monstrosity of dull color, a redead is renowned for instilling such fear that its victim completely loses the capability to move. Once a victim is immobilized by terror, the redead lurches towards it with eerily slow movement. The monster's four leathery limbs all wrap around its victim at once—further immobilizing the poor creature—and the redead's blunt teeth begin to tear and devour the paralyzed victim while it still lives. The few who have survived this experience are known to retain mind-rattling nightmares of it for the rest of their days.

# Skulltula ((+Skulltula))

A typical skulltula is a spider-like, eight-legged monstrosity that is the size of an adult hylian. Its hardened, armor-like carapace bears a striking resemblance to a large humanoid skull, hence the origin of the creature's name. Although these creatures can lay webbing traps like more mundane spiders, more often than not they actively hunt their prey. They are unusually skilled at melee combat, and some have even been known to block sword strikes.

Skulltulas usually dwell in areas of darkness, most commonly including caverns and forest depths. Small, young skulltulas are most often referred to as walltulas, and have fewer capabilities compared to their elders. If an area has even one skulltula or walltulla, there are usually a dozen or more hiding in the darkness nearby.

A creature may use a directed air effect, such as *gust of wind*, to blow the fumes away, which disables the stagnox's Noxious Fumes aura until the end of the stagnox's next turn.  While its Noxious Fumes is disabled, a creature may target the stagnox's backside.  The stagnox has weakness 5 to damage dealt to its backside.

# Stal ((+Stal))

Made from bones held together by foul necromancy, stal creatures are among the most common types of undead.  The word "stal" is Hylian for skeleton.  They are often found haunting old dungeons and forgotten cemetaries.

## Stal Abilities

Some stal creatures have one or more of these abilities.  If you give a stal creature more than one, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics, or apply the Sunlight Vulnerability ability to weaken them in sunlight to compensate for the additional power of its other abilities.
item(
**Blaze** The stal is wreathed in fire, which doesn't consume its bones or gear.  The stal gains immunity to fire and weakness 5 to cold, loses its resistance to cold, and its Strikes deal additional persistant fire damage equal to half the stal's level (minimum 1 damage).

**Bloody** The stal is covered in dripping blood and gains fast healing equal to its level.

**Bone Missile** :aa: The stal yanks a rib from its ribcage to use as an arrow or javelin.  The stal loses HP equal to its level (minimum 1), then makes a ranged Strike.  This uses the attack bonus of whichever of the stal's other Strikes has the highest attack bonus and deals piercing damage equal to the Strike's damage plus the skeleton's level (minimum 1).

**Bone Powder** When the stal takes physical damage from a critical hit, one of its bones is pulverized into a fine powder.  All creatures in a 5-foot emanation that breathe take 1d6 persistent poison damage (plus an additional 1d6 for every 6 levels the stal has).

**Collapse** :r: **Trigger** The stal is critically hit. **Effect** The stal collapses into a pile of bones and the attack deals only normal damage.  The stal can then reform in a standing position as an action, but until it does, it is immobilized and flat-footed.

**Explosive Death** When the stal is destroyed, its bones shatter and explode as the necromantic energy holding it together is released.  Adjacent creatures take 1d6 slashing damage per 2 levels (minimum 1d6) with a basic Reflex save.

**Screaming Skull** :aa: (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The stal removes its skull and throws it, making a jaws attack with a range of 20 feet.  It then attempts to Demoralize each foe within 10 feet of the target.  The head bounces, rolls, or even flies back, returning to the stal at the start of its next turn.  The stal is blind until then.

**Sunlight Vulnerability** (vulnerability) If exposed to direct sunlight, the stal becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the stal ends its turn in sunlight. If the stal loses all its actions this way, it is destroyed.

## Stalfos ((++Stalfos))
Taking the form of a humanoid animated skeleton, the exact construction and nature of a stalfos varies slightly with the race to which its body once belonged. In virtually all cases, a stalfos wields above-average power and fortitude thanks to the necromantic magic that empowers its eternal body.

Stalfos are seen as the most common form of humanoid stal creatures. They typically wield common or makeshift weapons, and can jump to uncanny heights thanks to the lightweight nature of their bodies. An average stalfos retain more mobility than the relatively sluggish stalchild, but lacks the inherent martial prowess of a stalfos knight or the vile magic of a dark stalfos.

**Head Regrowth** A staldra ordinarily has three heads. A creature can attempt to sever one of the staldra's heads by specifically targeting it and dealing damage equal to the head’s Hit Points. A head that is not completely severed returns to full Hit Points at the end of any creature’s turn.
A staldra can regrow a severed head using Staldra Regeneration. A creature can prevent this regrowth by dealing vitalic damage to the stump, cauterizing it. Single-target vitalic effects need to be targeted at a specific stump, but effects that deal splash damage or affect areas covering the hydra’s whole space cauterize all stumps if they deal vitalic damage. If the attack that severs a head deals any vitalic damage, the stump is cauterized instantly. If all three heads are cauterized, the staldra dies.

**Multiple Opportunities** A staldra gains an extra reaction per round for each of its heads beyond the first, which it can use only to make Reactive Strikes. It can’t use more than 1 reaction on the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within its reach, and the staldra must use a different head for each Reactive Strike it makes. Whenever one of the staldra's heads is severed, the staldra loses 1 of its extra reactions per round.

**Reactive Strike** :r:

**Staldra Regeneration** The staldra has regeneration equal to 5 x the number of heads it has. If a staldra's body is missing any heads and the remaining stumps have not been cauterized, the staldra attempts a DC 23 Fortitude save after it regains Hit Points from regeneration.  On a success, it regrows all heads that have been severed.  The staldra's regeneration only fully deactivates if all its heads are severed at once and all stumps are cauterized, at which point it dies.

Even on a failed attack, the staldra deals the damage from one jaws Strike to the target creature, though it still misses completely on a critical failure. This counts toward the staldra’s multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of heads the staldra has.

**Storm of Jaws** :aa: The staldra makes a number of Strikes up to its number of heads, each against a different target.  These attacks count towards the staldra's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the staldra makes all its attacks.

To truly defeat a stalnox permenantly, the eyeball must be destroyed.

These tektite packs have an odd tactic: they leap great distances, then bodyslam their hard underbellies and legs into the prey with the intention of breaking bones and preventing escape. Once a foe is sufficiently unable to resist, they slowly devour the prey in nibbling bites—often while it is still alive. Tektites hunt indiscriminately, slamming into everything from small birds to traveling merchants, but rarely approach foes several times their size.

The twili are a race of shadow beings who inhabit the Twilight Realm.  Although usually a peaceful tribe, the Twili have been known to be transformed into hideous creatures known as shadow beasts by powerful dark magic to invade Hyrule or other regions of the Light World.

The twili are descendants of a tribe of hylian sorcerers from Hyrule, who are referred to as Interlopers.  Eons ago, the Interlopers were condemned to the Twilight Realm by the Golden Goddesses of Hyrule as punishment for their misgoverned attempt to use magic to claim the Triforce.  Their old magic became known as the Fused Shadow, an instrument of dark power.  However, during their failed attempt to conquer the Sacred Realm, their Fused Shadow was split into four pieces and scattered throughout the Twilight Realm and Hyrule.  The tribe lived and evolved in the Twilight Realm for centuries in isolation, mere shadows of what they once were, as over time they became accustomed to their surroundings and came to accept their fate.  While some learned to love the beautiful peace that could only be found in Twilight, others felt that they were being oppressed by the people of the Light World.  The twili lost their most powerful abilities but they still possess some magical power and teleportation is possible for the strongest twili.

The twili have glowing markings on their skin, which is black and pale bluish-gray in color.  This complexion may be due to lack of full light as the twili transformed after they were ejected from the World of Light. They also have oval eyes that are normally red, yellow, or orange.  They are usually quite thin and much taller than hylians.

## Shadow Emissary ((++Shadow Emissary))
Shadow emissaries are bestial forms of twili warped by dark magic, either a predecessor of the magic used to produce the more widely known shadow beasts or intentionally designed to produce more bestial servants.  They are usually sent early in twili invasions to clear out regions before the main twili force arrives.  Shadow emissaries are incredibly vicious and will not let up once their target is in their grasp, gnawing with powerful jaws.

# Wallmaster ((+Wallmaster))

A wallmaster appears as a gigantic and disembodied humanoid hand of a jet black and slightly violet color, usually with sharpened nails. It crawls along walls and ceilings of vile temples, corrupted ruins, or other structures filled with dark magic. Not needing to eat or even breathe, one these magically created creatures exists solely to protect its habitat from invaders. If any foreign entity enters the structure it guards, the wallmaster falls upon it, clutching it tightly in its grip. In a blur of black smoke, the clutched victim is knocked unconscious and returned to the entrance of whatever structure the wallmaster is protecting.

A wallmaster is able to maneuver overground by crawling on its five huge fingers. More often than not, however, a wallmaster will magically fly back up to the spot from which it pounced, waiting eternally for the next invader.

Wallmasters are related to floormasters, and usually bear an almost identical appearance. Unlike a floormaster, a wallmaster sticks to ceilings and walls, and almost always attacks by dropping on its victims and teleporting them away. A wallmaster lacks the more robust combat abilities of a floormaster, and most floormasters lack the ability to teleport victims
