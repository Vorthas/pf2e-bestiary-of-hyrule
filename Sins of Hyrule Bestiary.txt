This is a companion bestiary to the *Bestiary of Hyrule* with creatures specific to the Sins of Hyrule setting based on the Hyrule Conquest mod for 0ad.  Much of the lore for these creatures will be specific to that setting rather than the general Zelda setting, though you may use some of these creatures for a generic Zelda setting to add more diversity.

### Differently Leveled Creatures
If you want to use a creature found in this bestiary, but of a different level, you can use the **Building Creatures** rules, found starting on page 56 in the *Gamemastery Guide* to adjust the statistics to match the new level.

### Triforce Alignment
All creatures in this document will have a Triforce alignment.  See the *Sins of Hyrule Setting* document for more details on this variant alignment.

### Aligned Damage
You may see some damage types listed as Radiant or Malice damage.  These are more generic renamed versions of Good and Evil damage (pre-Remaster).  Post-Remaster, these damage types will become Spirit damage with the Radiant or Malice traits instead of Holy or Unholy.

Both Radiant and Malice damage can harm creatures of any alignment, though Malice damage may deal extra damage to those not of Anti-Triforce alignment and Radiant damage may deal extra damage to those of Anti-Triforce alignment.

# Key Terms.
You'll see the following key terms and traits throughout this document.
    **Druthulidi** Druthulidi are the demons of the Dark Realm and are usually attached as a trait alongside Aberration or Fiend.  Almost all Druthulidi are weak to Radiant damage.
    **Malice:** The malice trait is usually associated with the Anti-Triforce alignment trait and almost always derived from the powers of the Dark Realm.  It is the antithesis of the force of Creation, known as Radiance, that stems from the Triforce.  Malice is generated from the darkest depths of one's heart.  The use of items or spells with the Malice trait risk tainting the heart, driving the user into darkness.
    **Radiance:** The radiance trait is associated with the light of the Triforce and the Golden Goddesses.  It is the antithesis of the Dark Realm's malice, being the energy of Creation itself.  A creature of the Dark Realm that uses an item or spell with the radiance trait risks burning itself out of existence entirely.
    **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability trait is used to indicate a specific vulnerability of a creature that may be triggered by targeting a specific location on the creature or by using a specific item or weapon.

# Darknut Legion ((+Darknut Legion))
The Darknuts (the Gerudo word for Cliff Lords) are a canine race that originated from the mountain ranges west and south of the Gerudo desert. They are an ancient people, predated only by races of legend such as the Oocca and Fairies. In the past, their civilisation almost fell apart through civil warfare, and conflicts with border races such as the Gerudo and Moblins nearly resulted in the extinction of their race. Facing the end of their people, the warring leaders decided to put aside their differences and declared that from there on out every single Darknut would be trained to be a disciplined and unstoppable warrior at adolescence. After devising a rigorous code from which to follow, the Darknut Legion and its infamous armored warriors were born.

From an early age, Darknuts are trained to wield the best armour, the biggest swords, and maintain the highest order of discipline to preserve their creed. Darknut philosophy places focus on the individual: if one soldier cannot master himself, then it is impossible for him to function in a group. For this reason, Darknuts often prefer to fight alone in engagements, leaving their comrades to their own devices when fighting against groups. When assembled into an army, the Darknuts are without a doubt the single most powerful force to walk Hyrule.

This has come at a price, however, as the Darknut Legion places focus on the sword. Their faction has no archers at all, and little cavalry. That, combined with their slow speed, makes them hard to master despite their obvious prowess in a hand-to-hand fight. Regardless, a wall of Darknuts shrugging off hundreds of arrows as they slowly advance is bound to put doubt into most armies that they face.

note(
**Errata** All Darknuts in the Sins of Hyrule setting know the Darknut language and are LN.

## Doomknocker ((++Doomknocker))
Doomknockers are large and powerful Darknut warriors, with many years of experience to their name. Wielding a giant mace and durable shield, Doomknockers would slowly and relentlessly march at their targets, shrugging off arrow fire without missing a beat. When in a melee they could pulverize and pummel just about any foe, even those with durable armor.

## Fokka Hypaspist ((++Fokka Hypaspist))
Flightless rito go by many names, but in their native tongue the term "fokka" is most often used. Although they lack flight, fokka have lightweight bodies built for swift movement and wield abnormal strength. Fokka are treated as outcasts, mutants, and foul creatures by most rito capable of flight. Whether it's their natural tendency or the result of this mistreatment, most fokka have a cruel and isolating disposition.  Many fokka joined the Darknut Legion to serve as light infantry in a legion where most soldiers are heavy infantry as a way to feel like they belong to some society after being outcast from traditional rito society.  Because they are outsiders, fokka are one the very few units of the Legion allowed to use ranged magical attacks in the form of beams of force, but fokka are rarely accepted as anything other than foreigners in the Legion because of this.

## Gymnitai ((++Gymnitai))
The unarmored light infantry of the Darknut legion.  These young and eager warriors had yet to become trained by the Legion, and therefore attempted to prove themselves as volunteer soldiers.  Those that survived combat or showed exceptional skill would be adopted into the Legion without question.

## Jermafenser ((++Jermafenser))
Jermafensers are some of the tallest and largest Darknuts in service of the Legion. Standing at nearly ten feet tall, these hulking behemoths slowly mustered their way into combat, effortlessly slicing apart anything smaller than themselves.  They also serve as commanders in the Darknut Legion, commanding other Darknuts in the heat of battle when the Legion has to fight as an army and not one versus one.

# Druthulidi ((+Druthulidi))
Druthulidi, sometimes collectively called Demons are primordial manifestations of sin and destructive chaos that arose on the world of Hyrule, Realm of Twilight, and many more.

The Drutuhlidi, unlike most mortal beings, emerged naturally as manifestations of sin and subsequent destructive chaos, spreading across cosmos at rapid pace and drowning many worlds in their own vice. Their role in the world could be compared to an ideological virus, infecting the minds of their victims with destructive urges and feeding on suffering, decay and destruction that results from the actions of the sinful. Each Druthulidi embodied a different vice, such as malice, fear, gluttony, wrath, desire for control, and ego.

The abilities of Druthulidi vary between individuals. Common powers that are shared amongst them are the ability to change size and form, as well as possessing other people through infection, physical force, or remotely through overpowering will. All Druthulidi are capable of breaking themselves down into smaller organisms and entities. Some Druthulidi like Majora are able to create entire armies via this method, while others like Vaati prefer to exist almost entirely in a disconnected state. The Druthulidi Iemanis created the entire race of Gohma by giving the entities he made some level of autonomy, allowing them to continue after he was destroyed. Druthulidi also have the ability to travel between worlds and planets, with certain beings like Demise being able to transport others alongside himself. 

### The Druthulidi
* Bellum
* Demise
* DethI
* Iemanis
* Majora
* Malice
* Vaati
=
# Bellum ((++Bellum))
Bellum usually appears as a mass of black tentacles that shroud its larger form. Much like other Druthulidi, these tentacles crown a single enormous yellow eye, and each tentacle additionally bears a single eye on its tip as well. Bellum often appears quite massive and is considered the largest Druthulidi on record next to Majora. Bellum is the only Druthulidi that has never been assigned a gender or adopted one itself, even by its own followers. 

Bellum's behavior is more animalistic compared to other notable Druthulidi, traveling from world to world and consuming whatever it desires. It often accomplishes its tasks in very crude and unrefined manners, preferring the most direct and brutal method possible. Bellum likely came to Hyrule to consume its biosphere and due to the majority of its surface being covered in water. It is barely even aware of its worshipers and the empire that follows it around. From Bellum's point of view, the Parella and River Zora are little more than a means of pest control.

note(
**Errata** All creatures from the Pathfinder Bestiary or Adventure Paths listed here gain the Anti-Triforce and Druthulidi traits and, if its Intelligence is -3 or greater, know the Demonic language.

**Jet** :aa: (move) The bellumite moves up to 200 feet in a straight line through the air or water without triggering any reactions.

**Unleash Tidal Wave** :aaa: (malice, occult) The bellumite unleashes a surge of malice-infused water that deals 5d6 bludgeoning damage and 5d6 malice damage in a 60-foot cone (DC 28 basic Fortitude save).  Creatures that fail the save are Pushed up to 20 feet and slowed 2 for 1 round (2 rounds on a critical failure).  It can't use Unleash Tidal Wave again for 1d4 rounds.

**Writhing Arms** :aa: The bellumite makes up to four Strikes with its arms, each against a different target. Each attack counts separately for the bellumite's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase the penalty until the bellumite has made all the attacks. If the bellumite subsequently uses the Grab action, it can Grab any number of creatures it hit with Writhing Arms.

# Demise ((++Demise))
Demise usually appears as a large eyeless mouth-like creature, covered in metallic black scales with glowing red veins. In this form he has no legs and moves with countless setae under the lower half of his body. Demise has also appeared in a much more humanoid form that sports the same black and red coloration.

Demise has been noted for having a very straightforward and obvious personality. He tends to be direct and maintains an aura of control over himself. Even when angered he tends to remain collected. Demise also seems to have a sense of honor; a trait not found in any other known Druthulidi. He prefers fair fights and would rather surrender when outmatched rather than resort to underhanded tactics to gain an advantage, as was demonstrated when he surrendered to Hylia. He also shuns the use of possession, preferring to win the allegiance of servants through fear or respect. Though Demise is physically genderless, it tends to prefer being referred to as male. Demise also has a passion for violence, simply travelling across the cosmos to fight and achieve dominance, it is this trait that leads to his quest for the Triforce, as a means to best Hylia.

### Demise Spawn Statblocks

# DethI ((++DethI))
Dethl is among the older of its kind, the Druthulidi, and like its kin, is a fundamental element of reality, the physical embodiment of the concept of fear. By mortal standards Dethl is utterly insane, its motivations chaotic and undefinable even to itself. It is defined by its insatiable fear of definition and existence, to the point if able to it would erase itself from existence. It is, by nature, utterly cowardly, fleeing into the shadows the moment its mad plots unravel.

Dethl's presence distorts the confines of reality, causing madness, decay, and death. The most hideous manifestation of this are the undead, beings twisted into existence by the laws of life and death being warped. Wherever shadows conceal horrors and secrets, the whispers of Dethl creep into the dreaming minds of those consumed by fear and insanity, eating away their minds. Eventually these poor souls are compelled to cut off their own heads, only for a horror birthed of their own nightmares to blossom from the stump like a flower and mutate the corpse as its new body. These are the Devoured, Dethl's spawn.

Dethl's physical form is nebulous and shadowy, screaming at the mere limitations of being physically defined. Constantly wreathed in shadow and void, it manifests as a trunk-like body with a single yellow glowing eye, with two appendages ending in flowerlike red eyes emerging like arms. It continuously screams at the horror of existence, and is surrounded by an stench that disturbs even other Druthulidi.

Like other Druthulidi, Dethl cannot be destroyed, as it is a fundamental element of reality. While its physical form can be overcome by powerful forces, it can only be defeated by mortal beings overcoming their primal fears, and will reemerge on another world, wearing a different name so long as fear is known somewhere.

**Spiral of Despair** :f: **Trigger** A creature becomes Frightened by a Demoralize check by the devoured. **Effect** As the devoured invades the triggering creature’s mind and plants the seeds of negative emotions, it also strips away the target’s feelings of hope or positivity. The devoured can immediately end a single emotion effect from which the triggering creature is benefiting.
)
=
# Iemanis ((++Iemanis))
Iemanis was a massive Druthulidi with arthropod characteristics. Its actual appearance is relatively unknown as there are few records of its existence. The Huskus describe Iemanis as 'a single eye, with countless claws, legs, and tentacles'.

Iemanis was more concerned with order and the pursuit of knowledge and survival rather than war and conquest. It wished to conquer Hyrule and absorb it into collective hierarchy where every individual would work together free of conflict for higher pursuits. As such, Iemanis had little value for individuality or luxury pursuits and often stripped its followers of free will. It was almost entirely concerned with survival and finding new ways to coexist or dominate over nature. 

Iemanis has a particularly strong will and was able to impose it on less intelligent creatures such as arthropods with ease. With enough time, Iemanis could remotely possess victims with its thoughts rather than the direct possession employed by its kin. This possession was so powerful that its victims would often be completely stripped of their personality and free will, becoming mindless creatures if Iemanis reliquished control over them. Iemanis was supposedly massive in size and could crush an entire army as well, rivaling both Majora and Bellum. Iemanis was also able to create entities of itself like other Druthulidi, though he imposed on them characteristics of other creatures depending on the task he needed them for. This eventually lead to the creation of the Gohma. 

### Iemanis Spawn Statblocks
* all Gohma
* Mothula (*Bestiary of Hyrule*)
=
# Gohma ((+++Gohma))
The Gohma are a very ancient race that once dominated a majority of Hyrule, having existed long before the Hylians and even the ancient Darknuts. As such, they are found as antagonists in the historical and religious texts of many races, usually associated with the Druthulidi **Iemanis**. The Gohma themselves are an arachnid species that thrives in swamps and otherwise dark and damp places. They feast on all manner of both living and dead things and are known for hunting down unaware people in the night.

It is commonly believed that all Gohma are mentally linked to each other, and that calling any lone Gohma an individual would be inaccurate. Each Gohma operates more like a disembodied hand or appendage to a greater mind that controls their race.

Whatever the case may be, their objective is very clear: expand and consume. Their desire of manifest destiny reflects in the armies; overwhelming numbers are the preferred tactic of their kind. Alone a single Gohma is weak, frail, and insignificant.  In large swarms they are a terrible force that can bring down the largest of foes when working in unison.

As such a Gohma army must be more concerned with surrounding and outmaneuvering an enemy army rather then facing them head on. The Gohma are masters at getting the upper hand in positioning, and when they surround a foe it's very easy for the enemy to want to make a run for it rather then stand and fight against an endless tide of spiders. A properly managed Gohma swarm is one of the most powerful combatants that an unfortunate army may face. 

note(
**Errata** All Gohma in the Sins of Hyrule setting have the Beast and Druthulidi traits instead of the Animal trait, with an Int score of -3 or higher.

# Majora ((++Majora))
While relatively absent in the land of Hyrule, the ever looming threat of Majora Worship spreading often keeps the zealous on their guard. When followers of Majora recognize that they are large in numbers they will usually establish the Church of Majora where they begin to train their armies and promise more people a place of power should they convert to the material deity. Armies assembled by the Church of Majora generally are composed of the same soldiers trained by every other race in Hyrule, though horrific spawn of Majora itself may disgrace the battlefield with their demonic and twisted presence.

The Church of Majora often sports both mask and moon imagery, worshipping both aspects of the dark god.  Some fell beasts associated with the moon may swear an allegiance to Majora, including various werecreatures and lunar devils.

## Mask Entity ((+++Mask Entity))
If Majora manages to bridge the gap into Hyrule, thousands of mask entities are bound to storm out of his portals to secure and terrorize the surrounding areas. Essentially serving as primary soldiers, mask entities are versatile for almost any infantry role.

Powerful fiends of the Dark Realm that have sworn themselves to Majora due to the god's association with the moon, selenians (or lunar devils as they are more colloquially known) can be found subverting druidical orders or leading packs of werecreatures. They are a lazy breed of fiend, and prefer lounging in the light of the moon over any more vigorous activity. The only exception is an opportunity to corrupt druids and moon-worshippers that do not worship Majora, pitting them against followers of gods associated with the sun or the Golden Goddesses and turning them to Majora worship.

**Reposition** :a:  The wrath entity attempts to move all creatures that it has grabbed into other spaces within the reach of its tentacles, rolling a single Athletics check and comparing the result against each creature’s Fortitude DC. On a failure, the creature remains in place, and on a critical failure, the creature is no longer grabbed.

**Storm of Tentacles** :aa: The wrath entity makes up to four tentacle Strikes, each against a different target. These attacks count toward the wrath entity's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after it makes all of its attacks.

# Malice ((++Malice))
Malice is a Druthulidi that was summoned into Hyrule in primordial ages. With the exception of Majora, Malice is said to be the oldest of its kind. It is believed to embody the rung of malice.

Malice is extremely unintelligent compared to the other Druthulidi, and it is debatable if it's even conscious. Instead of actively fighting for domination, it spreads like a mold passively, consuming and infecting what comes in its way. It reacts to and spreads via hatred and agony, earning its namesake.

# Vaati ((++Vaati))
Vaati is a notable and powerful Druthulidi that survived the purge of the Golden Goddesses. It is named after its first host, Vaati, a Minish sorcerer. Vaati is believed to embody the rung of ego.

Unlike most Druthulidi, Vaati prefers to remain a swarm of extremely small insect-like creatures that infect and take control of other creatures, slowly morphing them into a larger form. Individual Vaati are little more than black spheres dominated by a single eye and rows of cilia. When a victim has been fully transfigured they maintain the notable eye but also display powerful tentacles, appendages, and in some cases, wings. 

Vaati usually assimilates and maintains some level of personality from its victims. In turn Vaati's victims often display an increased sense of ego and self importance with a habit of taunting and boasting superiority. Though Vaati is physically genderless, it tends to prefer being referred to as male.

Vaati also has a massive inferiority complex compared to his stronger brethren, leading to his desire for the Wind Tribe's power so that he could increase his power.

While tiny, Vaati is able to unsuspectingly enter a victim's body and slowly take control of them. Once established Vaati will begin a long process of converting and morphing the body into a larger form to suit its purposes. This process often takes several centuries, but Vaati is able to prolong the life of its victims and halt the process of ageing. Victims are often completely unaware of Vaati's influence and believe all of their actions are their own.

When its victims are fully transfigured, Vaati displays tremendous physical strength because of its size. In some case Vaati is also capable of flight with an array of wings that grows from its body. Vaati can also assimilate abilities from its victims, such as the use of magical powers from its current host.

Like the rest of his kind Vaati has the ability to travel between worlds, how he achieves this is unknown.

# Fae Realm of Tarm ((+Fae Realm of Tarm))
One of the oldest and most mysterious races of Hyrule are the Fairies. Small glowing creatures that drift with the wind, Faries have for the most part acted peaceful and have even saved the dying from death. In recent times however the fairies have almost completely vanished from Hyrule without a trace. Signs seemed to point that they have migrated far to the northeast and into the land of Holodrum, and those that pursued the matter further discovered their gathering place at the legendary ruins of Tarm.

To many, Tarm is an enigma. According to legend, the Ruins of Tarm fell from the sky and around its resting spot the ancient Tarminians worshiped the structure as if it were a deity. In return for their fealty, the Ruins of Tarm would save the dying Tarminians just before their last breath. Historians often connected this resurrection with the use of fairies, and the fact that they have been gathering there seems to confirm the theory and prove that perhaps the fairies originated from the fallen Tarm Ruins. The true nature of this gathering is a mystery, but one cannot help but fear that they are creating an army.

The average Fairy is small, only slightly larger than a fist. Great Fairies tend to be much larger, some reaching heights of up to ten feet. The true form of a fairy is unknown, though Great Fairies will often appear as an extraordinarily beautiful female of the observer's race. The Fairies can assemble a massive army in short order and easily catch a developing kingdom off guard. Regardless, the tiny size of fairies makes them very poor combatants: one well placed whack of the hand can knock one out and potentially kill it. They may be small, but many rightfully fear a massive storm of the creatures lead by an enigmatic Great Fairy.

# Gerudo ((+Gerudo))
The origins of the Gerudo trace back to the Akkalan Civil War. In 2991 BG, King Rhoaban Gustaf I was assassinated by Baolin Nohansen I and Yom Daltus. His three children born of a secret affair with Siroc were smuggled out of Akkala to the remote mountain settlement of Calatia by Sir Bado "Groose" Harkinian, who then continued into the Gerudo Desert. Bado entered a relationship with an unknown desert woman, and his descendants would become the progenitors of the Gerudo, inheriting their father's characteristic red hair.

Desert-dwelling Hylian relatives calling themselves the Gerudo first appear in historical records from 2657 BG. The Hylians themselves were unsure of their kinship with these people, believing them to originate from the remote mountain Kingdom of Calatia. The Gerudo conquered much of the western and central Gerudo Desert, forming a powerful Empire that rivaled the Darknut Legion in the East, and constructed great cities and monuments, seeing themselves as a great garden in the desert. During this period the Gerudo expanded into the Plains of Ordona, taking the port city of Aslosus and establishing the colony of Faldoon along the southern Moruge Mountains. The ancient Gerudo were ruled by powerful patriarchal Emperor for over 1,000 years, but began to wane from over-exploitation of their desert home and wars with their neighbors. During this period Aslosus fell under the control of powerful Gerudo Pirates while Faldoon was abandoned due to the outbreak of a plague. Circa 1600 BG, a civil war led to the overthrow of imperial rule and the establishment of the Circle of Warlords, a de facto council of squabbling military leaders. Some 1400 years later, two sisters were born, becoming powerful Witches who virtually controlled the Gerudo from the shadows through puppet rulers.

By the time of Ganon, the once-mighty Gerudo had waned to a shadow of their former glory. In 1 BG, the Moblin King Ganon approached the Gerudo with offers of an Alliance, but as expected, was spurned by the haughty Circle of Warlords, and, with the aid of the Yiga mage Bongo, cursed the Gerudo's Oases so that the Gerudo would never again bear male children. As the curse spread throughout the Gerudo's empire, the Twinrova Sisters made their own move to steal the Triforce, marching to Hylia Marine with a rogue army, but were defeated by Hylian and Zora forces, and presented to the Circle of Warlords along with captured Yiga Clan Sheikah and criminal Fairies as a token of peace. The Circle would banish the most dangerous of the Gerudo and Yiga mages through the dreaded Mirror of Twilight, which they believed to be a gate to a void of no return.

# Gorons ((+Gorons))
The origins of the Gorons is largely a mystery. Goron oral history holds that their people were born in the depths of the earth long ago, however, the first recorded sightings of Gorons on the surface of Hyrule date to circa 2701 BG in the Death Mountain Range. The Gorons established cordial relationships with the nearby Kingdom of Hyrule and Zora Dominion, living peacefully for several centuries until the Zora, desiring the wealth of the Death Mountain Range, invaded in 2372 BG, but were swiftly crushed by the Gorons in a series of skirmishes. To dissuade potential future invaders, the Gorons allied with the subterranean--dwelling Lizalfos. The Gorons and Lizalfos inhabited the Mountains undisturbed until 645 BG, when the Volvagians emerged from deep under Death Mountain, conquering and enslaving the Gorons and Lizalfos. Despite the Gorons' plea for aid, the Hylians and Zora elected to keep the Volvagians at bay with tribute. For almost 700 years, the Gorons suffered under the tyrannical rule of the Volvagians and their Lizalfos servants. It was not until 15 BG that Goron rebellion movements began. Though largely unsuccessful, these rebellions continued through the next two decades. The Gorons finally found their chance at freedom during the Rise of Ganon, when the Volvagians allied with the Moblins against the Kingdom of Hyrule and Zora Dominion. With Hylian aid, the Gorons managed to overthrow their masters and their Blin allies, and reconquered the entire Death Mountain Range.

# Hylians ((+Hylians))
Hylians are a humanoid race descended from the Akkalans, and kin to the Sheikah, Ordonians, Gerudo, Calatians, Labrynnians, Horonians, and Arcadians, as well as the ancient Wind Tribe and Cobble. All being members of the same race descended from the mythical Firstborn. Additionally, the Twili, Lanayru Zora Hybrids, and High Zoran all share heritage with this race. Hylians are elfin beings identified by their long, horizontally tilted pointed ears, typically boasting light skin and fair hair. The Hylians traditionally believe their ears allowed them to better hear the words of the Goddesses. They boast a multitude of eye colors ranging from brown to blue, with the ancient crimson eyes of their Akkalan forebears being seen as a mark of pure blood.

Hylians are in general a stern, pious, and militaristic people, fanatically devoted to the Church of the Golden Goddesses and disliked by many other races for the zealotry, arrogance, and imperialism. An inherently urban culture, they gravitate toward compact, well-defended urban centers, dominated by grand architecture and self-sufficient urban gardens and farms. This is a remnant of their ancient plains lifestyles, favoring commanding, defensive settlements that could counter an attack from any direction. The average Hylian lives a comfortable, prosperous lifestyle compared to many other inhabitants of Hyrule, but ultimately is subservient to the whims of the ruling aristocracy - in times of war, most able-bodied men are drafted into military roles, with all civilians and their property becoming completely under the control of the Royal Family.

# Labrynnians ((+Labrynnians))
Labrynnians are the Hyrulean descendants of Akkalan refugees who settled the Brynna Plains while fleeing the Gohma circa 3000 BG. Labrynnians differ from their Hylian cousins in having slightly darker skin tones due to their semi-tropical homeland, as well as a more vertical tilt to their tapered ears.

Due to the lack of large monsters and animals in their homeland, the Labrynnians have quite significantly culturally diverged from their Hyrulean cousins. Their unfamiliarity with horses or other easily accessible and tamable draft animals led to the development of primitive steam engines, as well as the domestication of the native Blue Bears of the Nuun Highlands as draft animals. Labrynna is blessed with a wealth of geothermal activity, leading to an abundance of Sulfur or "Magic Powder," leading to Labrynnian experimentation with firearms. Barring their bloody early wars with the Lynels of Labrynna, Labrynnians have lived in relative peace and prosperity compared to the rest of Hyrule, however, they retain a strong military tradition, with knightly orders similar to their Hylian cousins.

Labrynna, already one of the most prosperous and centralized societies in Hyrule, experienced a rapid industrial revolution circa 100 AG, with the ascension of Queen Solado Ambi and the arrival of her mysterious advisor, Veran. With Veran's inherent genius and knowledge of Fairy and Twili magic, the medieval nation rapidly developed new technologies, political centralization, and economic growth. Among these innovations include their signature firearms, ranging from large cannons to portable breech-loading arquebus, as well as more civilian technologies such as simple steam engine powered vehicles, rail locomotives, carbon steel, and coal powdered factories. As a result, Labrynnians enjoy a wide amount of luxuries not available to anyone else in Hyrule, including mass-produced food, an organized police force, a centralized public education system, public hospitals, and professional armies led by dedicated officer corps.

Compared to their Hyrulean cousins, Labrynnians are on average more educated, secular, and urbane as a people, eschewing religious fanaticism and holding an inquisitive interest in other cultures. However, as a result of their sudden industrial renaissance, they tend to be highly materialistic, arrogant, and ethnocentric, disdaining superstition and viewing the rest of Hyrule as theirs to exploit. Organized religion is largely banned within the nation, with churches and religious objects being seized and burned, while a secular, empiricist view of the world is enforced through compulsory civilian and military education. While living under an absolute monarchy, Labrynnians tend to have access to a greater deal of economic mobility and personal liberty than many others in Hyrule, with gender equality existing among both the civilian populace and military and being one of the few nations on the continent where homosexuality is tolerated.

# Lizal ((+Lizal))
The Lizalfos are a primal and violent race of reptilian beings. It is believed that they are native to the Death Mountain range, though they have spread throughout the Kokiri Forest and can be found as far south as Ordona Province. A simple people, the Lizalfos enjoy a simple life. They also enjoy starting fights with non-Lizalfos. Regardless of their violent tendencies, the Lizalfos do not fight out of hatred or a need to conquer, they simply think fighting is a way to show that you respect your neighbor. Naturally, this is backward to many people, and as such the Lizalfos are considered by many to be a threat in need of extermination.

They have a strong sense of community among their kind, and would rather fight in pairs or with a group along. For this reason, the Lizalfos are renowned for their coordinated attacks and swift flanking tactics. This nature reflects in their armies as well as the Lizalfos tend to hide in their environment, split up their forces, and flank an enemy from multiple sides. Their affinity for melee and fast speed makes them very adept for charges, and an infantry charge of Lizalfos is almost as effective as even the most brutal cavalry charges.

Despite their speed and clever minds, Lizalfos tend to prefer crude weaponry and very little armor other than helmets. While their scales are thicker than the skin of most races, they are still vulnerable to a well-placed blow from a sword. They may lack in durability, but even so, the odds of an enemy surviving a Lizalfos that makes the first move are low and rightfully so.

# Moblins ((+Moblins))
The Blin races of the southwest lands of Hyrule are one of the older races to inhabit the land. Most Blins are humanoid and share similar features, the most common being a piggish face. It's believed all Blins shared a common ancestor, but over time, their uncoordinated mating led to many changes. The dominant race of their kind would be the Moblins, the largest and strongest of the region. Leadership in their tribes is determined by who is the best, and by best, that usually means who can bash in someone's head the fastest.

Despite the fact that a majority of Moblins are rather unintelligent, figureheads of their kind tend to have unmatched cunning and, in some cases, tactical genius. As an army, the Moblins and their subjugated cousins are all bred for battle at birth. It's in their nature to fight, and they enjoy a good battle as much as any strong batch of ale. Their large size and lust for combat makes them a very aggressive army and one that's best suited for brute force and head-on clashes. Despite this, the stupid intellect of most Moblins means that they are largely clumsy and uncoordinated in a fight. They'd rather fight amongst themselves to determine who gets to kill the soldier in front of them rather then work in unison to bring them down. Even with these drawbacks, a massive horde of Moblins can mow through most opposition with ease.

# Warlord Ganon ((++Warlord Ganon))
Warlord Ganon is the King of the united Moblin tribes, infamous for invading and nearly destroying the Kingdom of Hyrule and stealing the Triforce. He was chosen by the Blin war god, Demise, to be trained as a powerful warlord after his parents fell victim to a roving band of Hylian knights.

Ganon was the first Blin leader in centuries to unite the warring Moblin tribes into a singular powerful state ruled by the Blin Council. He allied himself with the Darknuts Legion and formed a plan to destroy the Hylians by obtaining the divine power of the Golden Goddesses, the Triforce.

Ganon wields the powerful Zuna-forged artifact known as the **Trident of Power** and wears a Zuna-forged set of iron armor with a red and gold cape.

# Oocca ((+Oocca))
The Oocca are an incredibly ancient civilization: undoubtedly the first to exist in the world of Hyrule. In addition to the First Sages, they were in direct communion with the Goddesses that created them and the world. Unlike the other creatures and civilizations that would inhabit the surface, the Oocca were created with specific intent and a finalized form. They were granted weak, frail, and useless bodies, but an intellect and technology far superior to anything that has been seen in Hyrule. From their inception they created and maintained massive self-sustaining and floating cities that hovered across the world. They crafted many tools that could manipulate inanimate objects and constructs to do what their physical bodies could not. Perhaps most importantly they created the most terrifying and destructive weapons ever unleashed unto the world.

Sometime in the distant past before recorded history, the Oocca suddenly ceased all contact with the rest of the Hyrule. They retreated into their many floating Sky Cities and vanished high above the world, slowly fading into legend and obscurity. Many civilizations in Hyrule continued to revere them after their departure, indeed many began to idolize and worship them as gods incarnate throughout history. Their reasons for their ascendance and disappearance remain unknown to this day. Despite this concealment, they are well aware of and active in Hyrule, manipulating and directing the course of history and assuring the spread of all religion centered around the three Golden Goddesses and the utter destruction and eradication of all Majora influence.

They have long kept themselves, and the biggest conspiracy in all of history, a well guarded secret for thousands of years.

# Dominion Rod Susceptibility
All Oocca constructs have a unique vulnerability to the Dominion Rod item.  An Oocca construct always treats the result of its saving throw as one degree worse against effects from a Dominion Rod and the incapacitation trait on an effect from a Dominion Rod does not apply to Oocca construccts.

# Demokan Scout
The Demokan scout, also called Surveyors, acts as the eyes and ears of the Oocca. These tiny disembodied heads glide through the sky and observe the world below them, absorbing and gathering information before landing armies into battle. Once combat has begun, Demokan scouts can act as ranged snipers in battle.

# Sheikah Cadre ((+Sheikah Cadre))
The Sheikah as a people are ancient, dating back to the times of Akkala. While records of their deeds are few, many legends surrounding the Sheikah placed them as mediators between Hyrule and the Oocca. The Divine Oocca would use the dark arts of the Sheikah as an instrument, rooting out corruption and demons. This role seems to survive into modern day despite the absence of their Oocca masters.

The Cadre's goals are not explicit to outsiders, though it seems in general they wish to direct history and avoid cataclysmic disaster and change. To accomplish this the Sheikah have adopted extremely subversive and secretive methods: Spying, bribing, black mailing, and assassination to change the course of events rather than military or diplomatic might. If there is a great and powerful monarch in Hyrule, odds are the Sheikah are responsible for putting them there and keeping them alive.

The ultimate instrument of the Cadre, the Assassins enforce the final judgement of the Clans and have long shaped the history of Hyrule. Should a king step out of line, a noble get too ambitious, or some wizard delve too deep into the magics of demons, the Assassin would carry out the will of the Cadre and remove them from history. Once marked by the Sheikah there are few who could survive the attempts on their life from one of these skilled murderers, and even then the Cadre would only send in another to finish where the first failed.

# Stalfos ((+Stalfos))
The fear of death is shared among all mortal beings and those that are fearful enough have, in the past, become entangled in many dark and unnatural means of preserving their lives. The Stalfos, also the ancient Hylian word for "of bones," are remnants of these long-lost endeavors to achieve long-lasting life. Little more than animated skeletons, Stalfos are completely mindless and, without guidance, will simply rot as any dead being would. In recent times, however, the Stalfos have slowly been assembling into an army under the guidance of unseen masters.

The Kingdom of Hyrule and many other races have done their best to utterly destroy all remnants of these undead, yet periodically they show up time and again. The fear of an all out Stalfos army looms in the hearts of many, and without a doubt that fear is becoming more true every day. The dead corpses and remnants of the long deceased are rising from their graves all the more and gathering in all the hidden corners of Hyrule. Being an army of mindless drones, the Stalfos have the advantage of being completely immune to all psychological effects such as fear.

It is impossible for a Stalfos army to flee, and they will fight until every bone in their carcasses are smashed beyond repair. Despite this huge advantage, the Stalfos lack muscles and their only means of movement is artificial: Stalfos move slowly and awkwardly and are relatively easy to destroy with a well placed hammer to the rib cage. Even though they may be frail in combat, most people would only dare to stand against the march of a Stalfos army coming to collect the corpses of the dead.

They can torch just about anything with their burning attacks, as well as defend themselves with their scythes in a melee.

# Twili ((+Twili))

Following the battle at Hylia Marine in 0 AG (Hyrule time), which sees the final defeat of Bongo's Dark Interlopers, Twinrova's Gerudos and Veran's Fairies who all came to seek the Triforce, the Hylian Princess Nylin Zelda I hands the prisoners of war over to the Gerudo Ring of Warlords. These Warlords then banish these prisoners into the Mirror of Twilight, a mysterious portal in the Arbiter Grounds, which they thought was the entrance to a void of no return.

Unbeknownst to the Warlords, the Mirror actually lead to the Realm of Twilight. After their arrival the prisoners struggle to survive in the harsh wasteland, and many of them die shortly after their arrival. However those that survived form a new civilization, and after thousands of years these criminals eventually evolve into the Twili.

For hundreds of years the Twili radiate into many cultural groups throughout the Realm of Twilight, pushing the aborigines and Shadow Blins to the wild and frozen far east, where they gather under the few remaining Dark Dragons.  The three main Twili cultural groups are the Twili, the Bonemold, and Oorgath

## Twili
The Twili are the most widespread beings of the Realm of Twilight, native to the ancient seabeds of the south, including the Palace of Twilight, Elmenzhia, Uzu, and Valran.They founded the Dynasty of Mizorant in the vicinity of where their ancestors first arrived in the Realm of Twilight from Hyrule, and have maintained the Kingdom for several thousand years despite numerous civil wars and coups. They drove indigenous beings such as the Dark Dragons and Shadow Bulblins east into the Nether Rifts through their expansions, earning the animosity of the tribes. Border conflicts and raids along their eastern border are commonplace.

The Twili have evolved into drastically different beings than their Hyrulean ancestors, partially due to adaptations to their harsh new world as well as magical interference by beings such as the Fairies of Twilight. While retaining a similar humanoid form, they have grown taller and slimmer, with much longer limbs and necks due to the low gravity of their home. Their skin lacks pigment, being an alabaster white or at times pale blue or cyan, often with colored blotches and markings. Their eyes have become pupiless and bioluminescent, glowing blazing yellow, to better see in the endless twilight of their home, and though their retain hair on their head and face like a Hyrulean, it can come in odd colors such as green and blue. 

## Bonemold
The Twili equivilent of Sheikah to Hylians, the Bonemold are an near equally bloodline-obsessed offshoot of Twili who strive to retain the blood of their ancient Yiga ancestors. This obsession with blood purity had led to a more Hyrulean appearance than others of their kind, with eyes with colored irises and white sclera. While magical bloodlines have long died off, they retain the physical flexibilty of their Sheikah ancestors, and the blood of Gerudo and other exiles has led them to be less inbred and sickly their their Light World counterpart. The Bonemold exist both as a martial order and political entity within the Dynasty of Mizorant, often pursuing their own strongly traditionalist agendas in opposition to the rulers of the Dynasty and their Fairy of Twilight puppetmasters. The Bonemold, while found across the Dynasty, hold lands west of Valran. 

## Oorgath
The most ancient and mysterious of the Twili, the Oorgath people ventured from the south many centuries after the Dark Interlopers were cast into the Realm of Twilight, crossing the Nether Rifts and settling in the far east. There they founded the lost kingdom of Oorgath and studied the magics of their dying world, crating magical masks that grant power or twist the wearer into the Shadow Beasts and Fused Shadows. Eventually they discovered the mysterious entities known as the Eclipse, which were the remnants of an ancient process of the world. Harnessing the power of the Eclipse allowed the Oorgath to perceive the fourth dimension, Time, which drove them mad. They shed their corporeal forms, becoming akin to Haunts or Spirits. Their ghostlike being appears like a Twili riddled with cracks emitting a sickly orange light, their digits stonelike claws and faces concealed by elaborate masks.

# Volvagian ((+Volvagian))
The Volvagians were among the last surviving Dragons on Hyrule, a race of reptilian beings that live within and breathe fire.

The Volvagians' homeland is the Death Mountain Range, where they constantly warred with the Gorons, Lizalfos, and Dodongos for power. When the Sage of Fire Maphaeus named Dakkon her successor, he promptly used his new Sage powers to win over the Lizalfos as servants, kill the Goron King Dalagra and enslave his people, and dominate the Dodongos as subservient beasts of burden. The Lizalfos and their kin enjoy a relatively privileged position as the Volvagians' enforcers and taskmasters, keeping a lash over their Goron slaves.

For five millennia Dakkon rules over his empire, crushing all rebellions from the Gorons, including a particularly large one in the first century before Ganon that resulted in the flight of the Lizalfos from Death Mountain.

Half-breeds became exceedingly more common as the population of pure-blood volvagians declined.  Sharing parentage with dinolfos, the half-breeds may not have been as massive as their volvagian sires, but they were no less vicious.  Because of their relative size, they often served more menial tasks and as soldiers; it was rare for a half-breed to ever become a Tyrant themselves.

# Volvagian Serpent ((++Volvagian Serpent))
The typical volvagian is a serpentine dragon anywhere from 15 to 30 feet in length, with a mane of fire and two limbs.  Volvagian serpents are rulers, administrators, and overseers of their fallen empire's territories.  A single serpent could outclass anything smaller than itself; it took large volumes of skilled warriors to mount any kind of attack against these creatures.

# Zora ((+Zora))
The history of the zora people is intertwined with the history of the Druthulidi Bellum.  There are three major branches of Zora civilization, the River Zora, the High Zora, and the Zora Hybrids of Lanaryu Province, with several smaller branches that are less well-known, such as the mysterious Ocean Zora that were the progeniters of the High Zora, and the Storm Zora who defected from the River Zora.

## High Zora
The origins of the High Zora stretches back over 5000 years, to the first Ocean Zora to settle on Hyrule. These Zora had been augmented from Zola by their Parella overlords with Hylian genetics to be better adapted to land, and fleeing their masters and brethren, first settled on the eastern Lanayru Coast circa 5500 BG, and had migrated into Spool Swamp by 5000 BG. Between 3700 and 3600 BG, the Spool Swamp Zora migrated into the Dominion Valley, founding the City of Domain Prime in the 3400's BG. By 3450 BG, the city was appearing in written documentation and the Zora Dominion was formally regarded as a world power.

## Lanayru Zora Hybrid
The Lanayru Coast was first settled by Ocean Zora circa 5500 BG. These Zora would largely migrate to the Spool Swamp within the following 500 years, but some remained in the region, eventually coming under the rule of the Zora Dominion founded by their cousins who had migrated inland. Roughly 1000 years later, between 4000 and 3000 BG, the first Akkalans migrated into the region from Arcadia, forming the five Houses of Akkala. By 3200 and 3100 BG, one family, the Daltuns had settled roots down in eastern Lanayru, particularly the area around Seshei. The Daltuns became immensely wealthy as Bankers and Traders, financing the construction of Akkala Citadel. Against the traditions of both Akkalan and High Zoran culture, those living on the Lanayru Coast began to interbreed, resulting in the first Zora Hybrids. These Hybrids, despite persecution by their mother countries, continued to grow in population until they absorbed largely absorbed House Daltus and its bannermen. Over the centuries Lanayru would eventually become an independent Province under the shared jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Hyrule and Zora Dominion, developing their own unique culture and ethnicity distinct from Hylians and High Zora.

## Ocean Zora
Not much is known of the Ocean Zora other than that for reasons unknown, they were banished into Termina by the Golden Goddesses.  They were the progeniter stock of the High Zora, with the latter being the mixture of Ocean Zora and Hylian genetics.

## River Zora
Nicknamed Zola by many in Hyrule, the River Zora are believed to be the ancient ancestors of the modern and civilized Zora. The Zora often consider this claim a hostile insult, though there may be truth in the matter. River Zora may not be civilized and may appear monstrous, though their predatory nature betrays their cunning and tactical skill. River Zora are infamous for hit and run attacks against superior forces, usually by springing from bodies of water, dealing a blow, and then quickly retreating into the water only to surface elsewhere. While they do have their own language and are able to communicate, they seem to have no interests outside of pillaging, raping, and destroying the inhabitants of villages they come across.

The River Zora originated from a world outside Hyrule. In the past, they came to worship the Druthulidi Bellum and became one of its most favoured servant races, second only to the Parella.  They arrived in Hyrule at the same time as Bellum and the other Druthulidi. They and their allies largely kept a low profile during the Druthulidi conflicts.
=
## Storm Zora
The Storm Zora are a Zora subrace who live on the Stormwracked Islands to the west of Crescent Island. Beneath the restless Sea of Storms the Zora of the Deep had remained unknown to the rest of Hyrule for thousands of years. Now something from below has forced them up from the ocean floor, setting up their cities along the edges of islands pelted by constant cyclones and tempests.  They are descended from a group of River Zora who renounced the worship of Bellum, ran away from their cousins and retreated deep into the Sea of Storms, where Bellum's influence doesn't reach.  Storm Zora can be distinguished from their High Zora and River Zora cousins by their black skin and bioluminescent organs.

![Primordial Gleeok](https://i.imgur.com/6kPL7Gq.jpg)
)

It is said that all gleeoks existing today are direct descendants of the Primordial Gleeok, a ferocious force of pure destruction that is usually believed to be mythical. It is said by some to have existed near the beginning of the Age of Myth, and said to be a mistake of the Golden Goddess of Courage, Farore. She erroneously created a being of such power that it threatened to destroy all mortal life in the Light World, and was consequently sealed away by the Golden Goddess of Power, Din. Those who revere the Golden Goddesses believe they are incapable of mistake, and consider the mere mentioning of this creature to be sacrilegious.

Descriptions and tales of the Primordial Gleeok vary, but it is always a wild monster with at least five heads, over 60 feet tall, of a stark crimson hue. It is frequently said to have four legs unlike the bipedal gleeoks living today. Some interpretations of tales embellish it even further, saying it had seven heads, or even a hundred—but no one surviving today has seen it firsthand, thankfully.

**Frightful Presence** (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 300 feet, DC 39

**Head Regrowth**  The primordial gleeok ordinarily has five heads. A creature can attempt to sever one of the gleeok's heads by specifically targeting it and dealing damage equal to the head’s Hit Points. A head that is not completely severed returns to full Hit Points at the end of any creature’s turn.
The gleeok can regrow a severed head using Gleeok Regeneration. A creature can prevent this regrowth by dealing acid damage to the stump, cauterizing it. Single-target acid effects need to be targeted at a specific stump, but effects that deal splash damage or affect areas covering the gleeok's whole space cauterize all stumps if they deal acid damage. If the attack that severs a head deals any acid damage, the stump is cauterized instantly. If all heads are cauterized, the gleeok becomes incapacitated indefinitely, but does not die due to the sheer amount of life energy flowing through its body.

**Gleeok Regeneration** The primordial gleeok has regeneration equal to 5 x the number of heads it has.  If the gleeok's body is missing any heads and the remaining stumps have not been cauterized, the gleeok attempts a DC 56 Fortitude save after it regains Hit Points from regeneration.  On a success, one uncauterized stump regrows two heads; on a critical success, two uncauterized stumps regrow into two heads each. The gleeok can never grow more than double the number of heads it ordinarily has. The gleeok's regeneration only fully deactivates if all its heads are severed and all stumps are cauterized, at which point it becomes incapacitated indefinitely.

**Multiple Opportunities**  The primordial gleeok gains an extra reaction per round for each of its heads beyond the first, which it can use only to make Reactive Strikes. It can’t use more than 1 reaction on the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within its reach, and the gleeok must use a different head for each Reactive Strike it makes. Whenever one of the gleeok's heads is severed, the gleeok loses 1 of its extra reactions per round.

**Reactive Strike** :r:
-
**Speed** 50 feet, fly 100 feet

**Melee** :a: fangs +45 (fire, magical, reach 20 feet), **Damage** 4d12+26 piercing plus 4d10 fire

**Melee** :a: claws +45 (agile, magical, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 4d10+20 slashing

**Melee** :a: tail +45 (magical, reach 30 feet), **Damage** 4d10+20 bludgeoning

**Primal Innate Spells** DC 48, attack +42; **9th** *scorching ray* (x3), *fireball* (x3), **8th** *wall of fire* (at will)

**Breath Weapon** :aa: to :aaa: (fire, primal) The gleeok breathes a blast of flame that deals 25d6 fire damage in a 90-foot cone (DC 52 basic Reflex save).  Creatures that fail the save also take 4d6 persistent fire damage.  If it uses three actions, it breathes two blasts of flames in two separate 60-foot cones, each dealing 15d6 fire damage and 2d6 persistent fire damage instead.  It can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.

**Focused Assault** :aa: The primordial gleeok attacks a single target with its heads, overwhelming its foe with multiple attacks and leaving almost nowhere to dodge.  The gleeok Strikes with its fangs.  On a successful attack, the gleeok deals damage from its fangs Strike to the target, plus an additional 1d12 damage for every head it has beyond the first.  Even on a failed attack, the gleeok deals the damage from one fangs Strike to the target creature, though it still misses completely on a critical failure.  This counts towards the gleeok's multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of heads the gleeok has.

**Storm of Jaws** :aa: The gleeok makes a number of Strikes up to its number of heads, each against a different target. These attacks count toward the gleeok's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after the gleeok makes all its attacks.
