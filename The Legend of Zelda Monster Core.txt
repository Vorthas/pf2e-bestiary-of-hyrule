pagenumbers

The world of the Legend of Zelda is home to many fascinating and unique creatures, many of which are monsters that stand in the way of heroes.  Using these creatures in a Pathfinder 2e campaign that is not a Legend of Zelda campaign may cause some dissonance, but with some flavor tweaks they could be used in a non-Zelda campaign without issue.  The same is true for using base Pathfinder 2e monsters in a Legend of Zelda campaign.
/
If a creature in this bestiary appears in multiple games with different traits, then the resulting creature will be an amalgamation of all the official depictions, or multiple variants of the creature will be listed.

### Differently Leveled Creatures
If you want to use a creature found in this bestiary, but of a different level, you can use the **Building Creatures** rules, found starting on page 56 in the *Gamemastery Guide* to adjust the statistics to match the new level.

All creature levels are set by a somewhat arbitrary metric based on approximately when a monster is encountered in a Zelda game, with some exceptions.  However, as the Legend of Zelda series is not an RPG (it's an action-adventure series), there are no official levels attached to monsters that could be used to approximate a proper level scaling.

### Companion to Adventures in Hyrule
This document is designed to be used as a standalone document, but it is also intended to be used as the bestiary to Aoife Ester's [Adventures in Hyrule](http://scribe.pf2.tools/v/wXO8Df9X) homebrew document for Legend of Zelda campaigns.

### Non-Canon Abilities
While most statblocks will try to adhere as much to game canon as possible, due to the nature of a tabletop game versus a video game, some liberty will be taken with statblocks.  New abilities may be added that make sense for a creature based on its physiology or to make it more capable to fight against a party of Heroes rather than a single Hero.

note (
# Key Terms.
You'll see the following key terms and traits throughout this document.
    **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability trait is used to indicate a specific vulnerability of a creature that may be triggered by targeting a specific location on the creature or by using a specific item or weapon.
)

|

### Vulnerable Spots
Some creatures have a vulnerable spot, such as an eye, that can be targeted for extra effects.  This is to simulate the Legend of Zelda boss weak point system.  Vulnerable spots will have the ***vulnerability*** trait on them.  Typically these will be called out in the statblock and require a -2 circumstance penalty to aim for the weak spot in return for extra damage or bypassing resistances and/or immunities.

A player can use the Recall Knowledge action to try and identify a Vulnerable Spot on a creature that has one. The GM can provide the player with the Vulnerable Spot in lieu of other best known attributes of the creature.

### Alignment Post-Remaster?
Alignment was left in for each creature despite alignment being removed in the Remaster for Pathfinder 2e for legacy reasons.  There are GMs and players who prefer to play with the old alignment system and so alignment on creatures is preserved for people who want to use that system.  If you want to be fully Remaster compatible, simply ignore the alignment trait in all statblocks.

### Other Bestiaries
Some monsters have been removed and placed into other bestiaries.  To find these statblocks, please see the following bestiaries.

# Ache ((+Ache))

## Ache ((++Ache))
Called "Eyes of Ganon" by townsfolk, Aches can disguise themselves in the villages of Hyrule as ordinary Hylians. Almost anyone you talk to may be an Ache in disguise, and they often reveal themselves and attack when talked to, striking unexpectedly.
right(
# Eyes of Ganon
Aches act as spies and messengers for the dark lord Ganon, often disguising themselves as townsfolk in hopes of luring potential heroes to an unwitting death.

## Acheman ((++Acheman))
Monstrous bats cursed by evil. They are similar to aches, though they do not disguise themselves as Hylians like their counterparts. Instead, they hang from ceilings in deep red, ache-like forms. When their prey draws close, they swoop to the ground and transform into bat-like men that spit volleys of fire. After they spit a few blasts of flame, they return to their ache forms and return to the ceiling.

# Giant Bats
The acheman is capable of transforming into an ache form or back into its monstrous humanoid form.

# Aerocuda ((+Aerocuda))
An airborne creature that can be recognized by its distinctive cries. They have strong, dexterous feet and can often be seen cruising through the sky with animals or other monsters in their clutches. Thankfully, the breed's lightweight, aerodynamic body makes it easy to shoot down.

right(
# Monster Drop Troops
Aerocudas are commonly found holding blins and lizals in their grasps, swooping in and dropping them as a primitive form of drop troopers in war.

# Ampilus ((+Ampilus))
Ampilus are desert-dwelling animals, resembling a cross between a squilla and an ammonite, with an ability to internally generate electrical energy. Their shells are able to disperse weight surprisingly well, allowing them to safely traverse desert sinksand.

right(
# Quicksand Traversal
Ampilus shells have a weight-dispersing property that allows them to remain afloat on top of quicksand.  Shrewd adventurers can make use of this property to traverse areas blocked off by quicksand.

# Armos ((+Armos))
There are many kinds of ancient statues inside the various dungeons of Hyrule.  Some of these statues are capable of coming to life, hopping after the intruder that alerted them.  It is not known who built or animated these statues as there are a multitude of designs, not matching any one civilization.  The tiny Minish, for example, created some armos statues that they can pilot, but not all armos are capable of being piloted in this fashion.

## Armos
An armos appears indistinguishable from a stone statue, and in fact is comprised almost entirely of stone animated by magic.  As a nonliving sentry, it remains dormant wherever its master or creator has placed it.  In many cases, an armos will stay on guard for centuries or longer, remaining as motionless as the stone statue it resembles.

right(
# Ancient Guardians
Armos are usually found in ancient temples, standing silently and unmoving, coming to life only when an intruder walks near.

One an armos is reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damage by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks and its Armor Class is reduced to 15.

**Death Burst** When an armos is destroyed, its body explodes in a 5-foot emanation of concussive burst.  All creatures and objects in the area take 3d6 sonic damage (DC 17 basic Reflex save).

## Armos Warrior
The armos warrior is a variant of an armos that boasts a huge shield that protects it from damage, and a sword that it directs seemingly telepathically.  Unlike other armos, the armos warrior is not mindless and is capable of conversation.

# Aruroda ((+Aruroda))
Large scorpion-like animals, aruroda are commonly found on beaches, in deserts, and inside caves.  They prefer to nest under the sand and also use the sand as a way to hide and ambush any potential prey that comes nearby.  Aruroda use their powerful venom to incapacitate prey and then drag the helpless creature underneath into the aruroda's nest to be feasted upon.  They are capable of igniting their venom and firing small globs of ignited venom from their stinger, sometimes hiding under the  stand with just the stinger exposed to stay out of sight while spraying ignited venom at threats.

right(
# Flammable Venom
Aruroda vneom is highly prized for its flammable properties, often being used in the creation of alchemist's fire or as a reagent for fire spells.
