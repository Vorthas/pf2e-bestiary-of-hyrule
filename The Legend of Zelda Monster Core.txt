pagenumbers

The world of the Legend of Zelda is home to many fascinating and unique creatures, many of which are monsters that stand in the way of heroes.  Using these creatures in a Pathfinder 2e campaign that is not a Legend of Zelda campaign may cause some dissonance, but with some flavor tweaks they could be used in a non-Zelda campaign without issue.  The same is true for using base Pathfinder 2e monsters in a Legend of Zelda campaign.
/
If a creature in this bestiary appears in multiple games with different traits, then the resulting creature will be an amalgamation of all the official depictions, or multiple variants of the creature will be listed.

### Differently Leveled Creatures
If you want to use a creature found in this bestiary, but of a different level, you can use the **Building Creatures** rules, found starting on page 56 in the *Gamemastery Guide* to adjust the statistics to match the new level.

All creature levels are set by a somewhat arbitrary metric based on approximately when a monster is encountered in a Zelda game, with some exceptions.  However, as the Legend of Zelda series is not an RPG (it's an action-adventure series), there are no official levels attached to monsters that could be used to approximate a proper level scaling.

### Companion to Adventures in Hyrule
This document is designed to be used as a standalone document, but it is also intended to be used as the bestiary to Aoife Ester's [Adventures in Hyrule](http://scribe.pf2.tools/v/wXO8Df9X) homebrew document for Legend of Zelda campaigns.

### Non-Canon Abilities
While most statblocks will try to adhere as much to game canon as possible, due to the nature of a tabletop game versus a video game, some liberty will be taken with statblocks.  New abilities may be added that make sense for a creature based on its physiology or to make it more capable to fight against a party of Heroes rather than a single Hero.

note (
# Key Terms.
You'll see the following key terms and traits throughout this document.
    **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability trait is used to indicate a specific vulnerability of a creature that may be triggered by targeting a specific location on the creature or by using a specific item or weapon.
)

|

### Vulnerable Spots
Some creatures have a vulnerable spot, such as an eye, that can be targeted for extra effects.  This is to simulate the Legend of Zelda boss weak point system.  Vulnerable spots will have the ***vulnerability*** trait on them.  Typically these will be called out in the statblock and require a -2 circumstance penalty to aim for the weak spot in return for extra damage or bypassing resistances and/or immunities.

A player can use the Recall Knowledge action to try and identify a Vulnerable Spot on a creature that has one. The GM can provide the player with the Vulnerable Spot in lieu of other best known attributes of the creature.

### Alignment Post-Remaster?
Alignment was left in for each creature despite alignment being removed in the Remaster for Pathfinder 2e for legacy reasons.  There are GMs and players who prefer to play with the old alignment system and so alignment on creatures is preserved for people who want to use that system.  If you want to be fully Remaster compatible, simply ignore the alignment trait in all statblocks.

### Other Bestiaries
Some monsters have been removed and placed into other bestiaries.  To find these statblocks, please see the following bestiaries.

# Ache ((+Ache))

## Ache ((++Ache))
Called "Eyes of Ganon" by townsfolk, Aches can disguise themselves in the villages of Hyrule as ordinary Hylians. Almost anyone you talk to may be an Ache in disguise, and they often reveal themselves and attack when talked to, striking unexpectedly.
right(
# Eyes of Ganon
Aches act as spies and messengers for the dark lord Ganon, often disguising themselves as townsfolk in hopes of luring potential heroes to an unwitting death.

## Acheman ((++Acheman))
Monstrous bats cursed by evil. They are similar to aches, though they do not disguise themselves as Hylians like their counterparts. Instead, they hang from ceilings in deep red, ache-like forms. When their prey draws close, they swoop to the ground and transform into bat-like men that spit volleys of fire. After they spit a few blasts of flame, they return to their ache forms and return to the ceiling.

# Aerocuda ((+Aerocuda))
An airborne creature that can be recognized by its distinctive cries. They have strong, dexterous feet and can often be seen cruising through the sky with animals or other monsters in their clutches. Thankfully, the breed's lightweight, aerodynamic body makes it easy to shoot down.

right(
# Monster Drop Troops
Aerocudas are commonly found holding blins and lizals in their grasps, swooping in and dropping them as a primitive form of drop troopers in war.

# Ampilus ((+Ampilus))
Ampilus are desert-dwelling animals, resembling a cross between a squilla and an ammonite, with an ability to internally generate electrical energy. Their shells are able to disperse weight surprisingly well, allowing them to safely traverse desert sinksand.

right(
# Quicksand Traversal
Ampilus shells have a weight-dispersing property that allows them to remain afloat on top of quicksand.  Shrewd adventurers can make use of this property to traverse areas blocked off by quicksand.

# Armos ((+Armos))
There are many kinds of ancient statues inside the various dungeons of Hyrule.  Some of these statues are capable of coming to life, hopping after the intruder that alerted them.  It is not known who built or animated these statues as there are a multitude of designs, not matching any one civilization.  The tiny Minish, for example, created some armos statues that they can pilot, but not all armos are capable of being piloted in this fashion.

## Armos
An armos appears indistinguishable from a stone statue, and in fact is comprised almost entirely of stone animated by magic.  As a nonliving sentry, it remains dormant wherever its master or creator has placed it.  In many cases, an armos will stay on guard for centuries or longer, remaining as motionless as the stone statue it resembles.

# Ancient Guardians
Armos are usually found in ancient temples, standing silently and unmoving, coming to life only when an intruder walks near.

# Aruroda ((+Aruroda))
Large scorpion-like animals, aruroda are commonly found on beaches, in deserts, and inside caves.  They prefer to nest under the sand and also use the sand as a way to hide and ambush any potential prey that comes nearby.  Aruroda use their powerful venom to incapacitate prey and then drag the helpless creature underneath into the aruroda's nest to be feasted upon.  They are capable of igniting their venom and firing small globs of ignited venom from their stinger, sometimes hiding under the  stand with just the stinger exposed to stay out of sight while spraying ignited venom at threats.

# Flammable Venom
Aruroda vneom is highly prized for its flammable properties, often being used in the creation of alchemist's fire or as a reagent for fire spells.

**Split** When the bari is hit by an attack that would deal slashing or piercing damage and has 10 or more HP, it splits into two identical bari, each with half the original’s HP. One bari is in the same space as the original, and the other appears in an adjacent unoccupied space.

# Blins ((+Blins))
A loose collection of monstrous humanoids with a common progenitor, the blin serve as rank-and-file soldiers for Ganon's armies. Nearly universally feared across Hyrule for their propensity to violence and brutal primitivism, the blin roam the wilderness - sometimes on direct orders from Ganon, and other times simply as hunters - making travel less safe as a result.

The second smallest and weakest of the blin tribes, the bokoblins make up for their size in large numbers. Not as cunning as the smaller miniblins, nor as strong as their moblin or bulblin brethren, bokoblins tend to act as cannon fodder in wartime or as common bandits led by a stronger moblin.

**Arrow Volley** :aa: The bokoblins draw or reload their shortbows and launch a ranged attack in the form of a volley.  This volley is a 10-foot burst within 60 feet that deals 3d6+3 piercing damage (DC 19 basic Reflex save).  When the bokoblins are reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 5-foot burst.

**Charge!** :aa: **Requirements** the horde has Formed Up; **Effect** The bokoblins lower their spears and charge.  The troop Strides in a straight line until they're adjacent to an enemy then use Lower Spears!, dealing 1d8+11 piercing damage.  Any creature that fails its save is also knocked prone.

**Form Up** :a:

**Lower Spears!** :a: to :aaa: **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The bokoblins engage in a coordinated spear attack against each enemy within 10 feet, with a DC 19 basic Reflex save.  The damage depends on the number of actions.
:a: 1d8 piercing damage
:aa: 1d8+8 piercing damage
:aaa: 1d8+11 piercing damage

**Troop Movement** Whenever the bokoblins Stride, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), the move up to their Speed.  This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the bokoblins enter difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to all the bokoblins.

## Miniblins ((++Miniblins))

An adult miniblin stands at a height comparable to a small hylian child, with facial features reminiscent of a mouse. These creatures are known for both the bizarrely unique chirping and giggling noises they make, and their uncanny ability to ascend even the smoothest of walls with ease. Like most moblins, a miniblin's coloration varies from one to the next, with reds and browns being the most abundant.

# Aquatic Miniblins
Some miniblins almost exclusively live out at sea.  They are usually identified by having small fins and are often seen wearing goggles.

## Moblins ((++Moblins))
Also known as big blins, brown moblins, or occasionally mudblins, these brown-skinned creatures are often considered icons of their race. A typical adult moblin towers most other humanoids, with over 8 feet of muscle and fat - a gruesome and intimidating sight that earns its title of "big." Although they usually live in wilderness among beasts, big moblins are generally apex predators in their environment. They have been known to populate almost any terrestrial landscape, but prefer temperate climates with abundant fauna due to their carnivorous diet.

Lord Bullbo's roar is also pitched much lower than a normal bullbo's, likely due to its size.

Deku scrubs are plant-based creatures that have skin made of wood and hair and "clothing" made of leaves and flowers, and spit deku nuts at their enemies when threatened. They usually appear in a small, flower-like tuft of foliage which they hide within when threatened. They often appear as enemies, but despite their antagonistic nature they tend to be friendly, at least when they believe it to be to their own benefit. It is rumored that a deku scrub's disposition can change drastically depending on the type of tree they are born from.

# Dodongo ((+Dodongo))
Dodongos are dinosaur-like reptiles that can grow to tremendous sizes. Most of them wield fire breath, immense physical strength, and thick armor-like scales. This combined with their feral aggression make them infamous monsters across the entire Light World. They have a notorious weakness to the thunderous detonations produced by bombs, and are almost single-handedly the reason any worthy adventurer keeps at least a few explosives at the ready. 

## Baby Dodongo ((++Baby Dodongo))
The infantile form of dodongos, baby dodongos are prone to exploding when killed. Despite being very young, they still have a nasty bite. They are small, serpentine creatures that slither along the ground, and burrow underneath for protection and ambushing.

## Kodongo ((++Kodongo))
A diminutive form of dodongo, kodongos are simple reptilian quadrupeds with a ravenous appetite. They are usually of either a red or green color, and bear some resemblance to unusually small rhinoceroses or triceratops. Kodongos dwell primarily in caves, ruins, and other dark locations, usually in small family-like packs. Kodongos spit blasts of magical flame at virtually anything that moves, with the apparent intent of roasting it alive and eating what remains—even if they aren't hungry. These beasts are believed to have been evolved to be impervious to heat just so their kind doesn't constantly roast and eat each other.

# Flamespitters
Unlike larger dodongos, a kodongo is only capable of spitting out a small mote of flame from its maw rather than sweeping fire.

## Young Dodongo ((++Young Dodongo))
A young dodongo is a baby dodongo that has grown but not yet reached reproductive maturity. Although it is the equivalent of a child and hasn't even fully developed mobile limbs, this monster's fangs and fire breath are more than capable of ripping and roasting the most formidable of creatures. Despite being relatively slow and clumsy for its size, this dodongo hunts endlessly to spur its growth into adulthood. Relatively few young dodongos thrive into the next stage of their life cycle, the king dodongo.

# Hungry Prowlers
Young dodongos often prowl the caverns where the dodongo brood lives, searching for any kind of prey to feast upon.

## Gecko Dodongo ((++Gecko Dodongo))
Dodongos that are adapted to smaller caves and have feet that allow them to stick to the sides of walls and ceilings like a gecko would, hence the name gecko dodongo. Gecko dodongos are not nearly as large as their other brethren, but they are no less deadly. They share the same weakness to bombs that other dodongos do, though their hide is not nearly as tough.

## King Dodongo ((++King Dodongo))
A rare baby dodongo is able to live into adolescence to become a young dodongo, and a rare young is able to thrive into full adulthood as a king. Fitting to its name, a king dodongo is usually the apex predator in whatever caverns or ruins it seeks to dominate. Its lair is often filled with younger dodongos who both serve their parent: the king. These younglings are protected by the sheer presence of the king itself, as its roars and utter power are known to clear almost any other creatures that would bring harm its offspring.

right(
# Hail to the King
Other dodongos rarely challenge the authority of the king dodongo, remaining subservient and in the young dodongo stage of their life.  In the rare event that two king dodongos develop in the same brood, the two kings will fight each other for control of the territory to the death or until one leaves to find a different area to raise a brood.

## Dongorongo ((++Dongorongo))

A dodongo-like creature, the dongorongo resembles a large armored lizard with crystals growing out of its back. Like a dodongo, it is vulnerable to explosives going off inside its body. Some speculate that the dongorongo is an evolved form of the dodongo, others say it is a magically enhanced dodongo. Either way, a dongorongo is a force to deal with in their homes deep inside volcanic mountains.

# Pure Metal
Dongorongo are found near deposits of a special material known as Crimsonine, one of the Pure Metals used to forge the Phantom Sword.  The crystals in a dongorongo's back are speculated to be this material.
