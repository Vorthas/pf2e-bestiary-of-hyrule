The world of the Legend of Zelda is home to many fascinating and unique creatures, many of which are monsters that stand in the way of heroes.  Using these creatures in a Pathfinder 2e campaign that is not a Legend of Zelda campaign may cause some dissonance, but with some flavor tweaks they could be used in a non-Zelda campaign without issue.  The same is true for using base Pathfinder 2e monsters in a Legend of Zelda campaign.

If a creature in this bestiary appears in multiple games with different traits, then the resulting creature will be an amalgamation of all the official depictions, or multiple variants of the creature will be listed.
/
### Differently Leveled Creatures
If you want to use a creature found in this bestiary, but of a different level, you can use the **Building Creatures** rules, found starting on page 56 in the *Gamemastery Guide* to adjust the statistics to match the new level.

All creature levels are set by a somewhat arbitrary metric based on approximately when a monster is encountered in a Zelda game, with some exceptions.  However, as the Legend of Zelda series is not an RPG (it's an action-adventure series), there are no official levels attached to monsters that could be used to approximate a proper level scaling.

### All Things Blin
*The Book of Blins* document is meant to be a companion to the *Hyrule Monster Core* general bestiary, intended to help reduce the sheer size of that document.  This document specializes in blins, a very common enemy type in the Legend of Zelda, ranging from the lowly miniblin to the powerful moblins.

### Non-Canon Abilities
While most statblocks will try to adhere as much to game canon as possible, due to the nature of a tabletop game versus a video game, some liberty will be taken with statblocks.  New abilities may be added that make sense for a creature based on its physiology or to make it more capable to fight against a party of Heroes rather than a single Hero.

note (
# Key Terms.
You'll see the following key terms and traits throughout this document.
    **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability trait is used to indicate a specific vulnerability of a creature that may be triggered by targeting a specific location on the creature or by using a specific item or weapon.
)
|

### Vulnerable Spots
Some creatures have a vulnerable spot, such as an eye, that can be targeted for extra effects.  This is to simulate the Legend of Zelda boss weak point system.  Vulnerable spots will have the ***vulnerability*** trait on them.  Typically these will be called out in the statblock and require a -2 circumstance penalty to aim for the weak spot in return for extra damage or bypassing resistances and/or immunities.

A player can use the Recall Knowledge action to try and identify a Vulnerable Spot on a creature that has one. The GM can provide the player with the Vulnerable Spot in lieu of other best known attributes of the creature.

### Alignment Post-Remaster?
Alignment was left in for each creature despite alignment being removed in the Remaster for Pathfinder 2e for legacy reasons.  There are GMs and players who prefer to play with the old alignment system and so alignment on creatures is preserved for people who want to use that system.  If you want to be fully Remaster compatible, simply ignore the alignment trait in all statblocks.

### Other Bestiaries
**The Book of Blins** is meant to be a bestiary for blin creatures.  For other statblocks, please see the following bestiaries.

* Hyrulean Monster Core
* [The Dead of Hyrule](https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/LxBRv4x1-the-dead-of-hyrule)
* Hyrulean Reptilians

# Bokoblins ((+Bokoblins))
Bokoblins are one of the most common types of blin, with many varieties existing across Hyrule and other realms.  They are larger and hardier than their miniblin cousins, but still small and subserviant to the larger moblins.

## Bokoblin Pirate ((++Bokoblin Pirate))
The bokoblins of the Great Sea act much the same as they do in Hyrule proper, only instead of banditry they resort to the seafaring equivalent of piracy.

right(
# Bokoblins of the High Seas
Bokoblins tend to band together in small pirate crews, usually under a more powerful blin like a moblin and raid nearby vessels.

# Horriblins ((+Horriblins))

# Moblins ((+Moblins))
Also known as big blins, brown moblins, or occasionally mudblins, these brown-skinned creatures are often considered icons of their race. A typical adult moblin towers most other humanoids, with over 8 feet of muscle and fat - a gruesome and intimidating sight that earns its title of "big." Although they usually live in wilderness among beasts, big moblins are generally apex predators in their environment. They have been known to populate almost any terrestrial landscape, but prefer temperate climates with abundant fauna due to their carnivorous diet.

## Great Moblin Mauler ((++Great Moblin Mauler))
A moblin that has grown even larger from the nutrients of the forest will become a massive great moblin. Instead of charging with a large spear, great moblins favor using a maul that they can smash into the ground to unleash a large shockwave at intruders into their lairs. They are not very common, usually only one or two are seen in an entire tribe of forest moblins.

**Shockwave** :aa:  The moblin slams its maul on the ground, unleashing a shockwave in a 30-foot cone, dealing 7d6 sonic damage to every creature in the cone (DC 23 Reflex save).  It can't use Shockwave again for 1d4 rounds.
