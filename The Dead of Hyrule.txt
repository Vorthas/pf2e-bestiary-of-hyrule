The world of the Legend of Zelda is home to many fascinating and unique creatures, many of which are monsters that stand in the way of heroes.  Using these creatures in a Pathfinder 2e campaign that is not a Legend of Zelda campaign may cause some dissonance, but with some flavor tweaks they could be used in a non-Zelda campaign without issue.  The same is true for using base Pathfinder 2e monsters in a Legend of Zelda campaign.

If a creature in this bestiary appears in multiple games with different traits, then the resulting creature will be an amalgamation of all the official depictions, or multiple variants of the creature will be listed.
/
### Differently Leveled Creatures
If you want to use a creature found in this bestiary, but of a different level, you can use the **Building Creatures** rules, found starting on page 56 in the *Gamemastery Guide* to adjust the statistics to match the new level.

All creature levels are set by a somewhat arbitrary metric based on approximately when a monster is encountered in a Zelda game, with some exceptions.  However, as the Legend of Zelda series is not an RPG (it's an action-adventure series), there are no official levels attached to monsters that could be used to approximate a proper level scaling.

### Undead Companion
*The Dead of Hyrule* document is meant to be a companion to the *Hyrule Monster Core* general bestiary, intended to help reduce the sheer size of that document.  This document specializes in creatures that are undead.

### Non-Canon Abilities
While most statblocks will try to adhere as much to game canon as possible, due to the nature of a tabletop game versus a video game, some liberty will be taken with statblocks.  New abilities may be added that make sense for a creature based on its physiology or to make it more capable to fight against a party of Heroes rather than a single Hero.

note (
# Key Terms.
You'll see the following key terms and traits throughout this document.
    **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability trait is used to indicate a specific vulnerability of a creature that may be triggered by targeting a specific location on the creature or by using a specific item or weapon.
)
|

### Vulnerable Spots
Some creatures have a vulnerable spot, such as an eye, that can be targeted for extra effects.  This is to simulate the Legend of Zelda boss weak point system.  Vulnerable spots will have the ***vulnerability*** trait on them.  Typically these will be called out in the statblock and require a -2 circumstance penalty to aim for the weak spot in return for extra damage or bypassing resistances and/or immunities.

A player can use the Recall Knowledge action to try and identify a Vulnerable Spot on a creature that has one. The GM can provide the player with the Vulnerable Spot in lieu of other best known attributes of the creature.

### Alignment Post-Remaster?
Alignment was left in for each creature despite alignment being removed in the Remaster for Pathfinder 2e for legacy reasons.  There are GMs and players who prefer to play with the old alignment system and so alignment on creatures is preserved for people who want to use that system.  If you want to be fully Remaster compatible, simply ignore the alignment trait in all statblocks.

### Other Bestiaries
**The Dead of Hyrule** is meant to be a bestiary for undead creatures.  For other statblocks, please see the following bestiaries.

* Hyrulean Monster Core
* The Book of Blins
* Hyrulean Reptilians

# Bubble ((+Bubble))

The bubble is a flying skull with blue flames and the deadly ability to jinx creatures who are unfortunate enough to be caught up in the flames. Those jinxed by a bubble find themselves afflicted with a curse that prevents them from fighting back, though wise adventurers always bring a shield to help extinguish the occult flames.

# Skull Camouflage
Bubbles disguise themselves as the skulls of corpses in the dungeons that they inhabit, coming to life when a creature comes near.

# Dead Hand ((+Dead Hand))
A dead hand has a zombie-like head with a large jaw. Its blood is a green color, and red blotches, thought to be bloodstains, cover its body. Multiple seemingly disembodied hands circle the chamber in which the dead hand resides. The creature uses these hands to snag prey, at which point its main body emerges from the ground to consume the captured meal.

right(
# Lair of Hands
A dead hand's lair typically is an empty room with several of its hands poking up from beneath the ground, with the main body remaining underground and out of sight until prey has been captured.

## Ghini ((+Ghini))
Ghini are one-eyed spirits that are normally found in graveyards, often depicted with their tongues lolling out of their mouths. They use this tongue to absorb the life force of people who wander into graveyards and disturb their resting places. A ghini has a ghostly tail it can extend to wrap around a person to immobilize them before licking their life force away.

The giant ghini is a larger version of the standard ghini that has smaller ghinis orbiting it.

# Stal ((+Stal))

Made from bones held together by foul necromancy, stal creatures are among the most common types of undead.  The word "stal" is Hylian for skeleton.  They are often found haunting old dungeons and forgotten cemetaries.

## Stal Abilities

Some stal creatures have one or more of these abilities.  If you give a stal creature more than one, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics, or apply the Sunlight Vulnerability ability to weaken them in sunlight to compensate for the additional power of its other abilities.
item(
**Blaze** The stal is wreathed in fire, which doesn't consume its bones or gear.  The stal gains immunity to fire and weakness 5 to cold, loses its resistance to cold, and its Strikes deal additional persistant fire damage equal to half the stal's level (minimum 1 damage).

**Bloody** The stal is covered in dripping blood and gains fast healing equal to its level.

**Bone Missile** :aa: The stal yanks a rib from its ribcage to use as an arrow or javelin.  The stal loses HP equal to its level (minimum 1), then makes a ranged Strike.  This uses the attack bonus of whichever of the stal's other Strikes has the highest attack bonus and deals piercing damage equal to the Strike's damage plus the skeleton's level (minimum 1).

**Bone Powder** When the stal takes physical damage from a critical hit, one of its bones is pulverized into a fine powder.  All creatures in a 5-foot emanation that breathe take 1d6 persistent poison damage (plus an additional 1d6 for every 6 levels the stal has).

**Collapse** :r: **Trigger** The stal is critically hit. **Effect** The stal collapses into a pile of bones and the attack deals only normal damage.  The stal can then reform in a standing position as an action, but until it does, it is immobilized and flat-footed.

**Explosive Death** When the stal is destroyed, its bones shatter and explode as the necromantic energy holding it together is released.  Adjacent creatures take 1d6 slashing damage per 2 levels (minimum 1d6) with a basic Reflex save.

**Screaming Skull** :aa: (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The stal removes its skull and throws it, making a jaws attack with a range of 20 feet.  It then attempts to Demoralize each foe within 10 feet of the target.  The head bounces, rolls, or even flies back, returning to the stal at the start of its next turn.  The stal is blind until then.

**Sunlight Vulnerability** (vulnerability) If exposed to direct sunlight, the stal becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the stal ends its turn in sunlight. If the stal loses all its actions this way, it is destroyed.

## Stalkoblin ((++Stalkoblin))
The stalkoblin is the resurrected skeleton of a bokoblin, usually raised by dark magic.  They are individually very weak, but the numerous bokoblins that have been killed by adventurers throughout Hyrule makes them a very common sight after dark away from heavily populated areas.

**AC** 26 all-around vision; **Fort** +19, **Ref** +16, **Will** +13

**HP** 25 ((head) void healing, head regrowth); **Immunities** area damage, bleed, death effects, disease, mental, paralyze, poison, unconscious; **Resistances** cold 5, electricity 5, fire 5, piercing 5

**Head Regrowth** A staldra ordinarily has three heads. A creature can attempt to sever one of the staldra's heads by specifically targeting it and dealing damage equal to the head’s Hit Points. A head that is not completely severed returns to full Hit Points at the end of any creature’s turn.
A staldra can regrow a severed head using Staldra Regeneration. A creature can prevent this regrowth by dealing vitality damage to the stump, cauterizing it. Single-target vitality effects need to be targeted at a specific stump, but effects that deal splash damage or affect areas covering the hydra’s whole space cauterize all stumps if they deal vitality damage. If the attack that severs a head deals any vitality damage, the stump is cauterized instantly. If all three heads are cauterized, the staldra dies.

**Multiple Opportunities** A staldra gains an extra reaction per round for each of its heads beyond the first, which it can use only to make Reactive Strikes. It can’t use more than 1 reaction on the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within its reach, and the staldra must use a different head for each Reactive Strike it makes. Whenever one of the staldra's heads is severed, the staldra loses 1 of its extra reactions per round.

**Reactive Strike** :r:

**Staldra Regeneration** The staldra has regeneration equal to 5 x the number of heads it has. If a staldra's body is missing any heads and the remaining stumps have not been cauterized, the staldra attempts a DC 23 Fortitude save after it regains Hit Points from regeneration.  On a success, it regrows all heads that have been severed.  The staldra's regeneration only fully deactivates if all its heads are severed at once and all stumps are cauterized, at which point it dies.

**Focused Assault** :aa: The staldra attacks a single target with its heads, overwhelming its foe with multiple attacks and leaving almost nowhere to dodge. The staldra Strikes with its jaws. On a successful attack, the staldra deals damage from its jaws Strike to the target, plus an additional 1d8 damage for every head it has beyond the first. Even on a failed attack, the staldra deals the damage from one jaws Strike to the target creature, though it still misses completely on a critical failure. This counts toward the staldra’s multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of heads the staldra has.

**Storm of Jaws** :aa: The staldra makes a number of Strikes up to its number of heads, each against a different target.  These attacks count towards the staldra's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the staldra makes all its attacks.

## Stalmaster ((++Stalmaster))
The stalmaster is an elite captain of undead soldiers. When provoked, it has the ability to strike with all four of its sword-wielding arms. The regular arsenal of a stalmaster is three swords and an axe, though they have been known to use other one-handed weapons.
